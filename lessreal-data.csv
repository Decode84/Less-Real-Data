2;(Psycho-Pass Extended Edition);Makishima Shougo;Clausewitz, he pointed out that no matter how carefully one plans, on the battlefield, even the smallest of details can cause setbacks.

29;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Souhei Saikawa;Luxury means something with no meaning at all;;;;;;;;
30;(Danganronpa The Animation);Junko Enoshima;For me, despair is not a goal, or a set of principles, or a lifestyle, or even an instinct... It's what defines me as Junko Enoshima! It's just my characterization! That's why I'm able to pursue despair with such purity!;;;;;;;;

What held us diverse brothers together was the love of our mother, deeper than the sea, and the farewell we bid our great father.  Sometimes, one profound separation can unite the ones left behind.  ;;;;;;;;

71;(Dice: The Cube That Changes Everything);Dongtae;Game!? Is life a game to you?...Life is not a game!!;;;;;;;;
72;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Crusch Karsten;Stand up! lift your faces! Take up your weapons! Look at that boy. He's so weak and fragile a breath could blow him away and he's unarmed! He is a powerless boy, whose defeat I have seen with my own eyes! He's weaker than anyone else here! Yet he's shouting louder than anyone that we can still do this so how can we sit down, with downcast gaze? If our weakest man has not given up how is kneeling in defeat acceptable for us? Did you come this far to wallow in shame? ;;;;;;;;
73;(Kimi no Na wa);Taki Tachibana;I wanted to tell you that… Wherever you may end up in this world, I will be searching for you.;;;;;;;;

75;(Kimi no Na wa);Mitsuha Miyamizu;If I suddenly showed up, would I bother him? Surprise him? There’s no way we could meet. But what if we did? What should I do? Would I annoy him? Would it be awkward? Or maybe… He’d be a bit glad to see me?;;;;;;;;
76;(Kimi no Na wa);Taki Tachibana;Once in a while when I wake up, I find myself crying. The dream I must’ve had, I can never seem to recall...But the sensation that I’ve lost something lingers for a long time after I wake up.;;;;;;;;

Farewell, Hotaru.  I wonder if that person understood...just that person.;;;;;;;;
84;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Natsume Takeshi;We probably are.  I can't explain it very well, but it seems that lately it doesn't matter, human or spirit.  If your hearts touch, it's the same thing.  When you're all alone, you get lonely, and the first step is always scary.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
86;(Three Days of Happiness);Three Days of Happiness;People who’ve had lots of failures talk about those failures as if to imply that if they have another life, they’ll be a big success. After facing all that hardship, they think they won’t mess up again. But they’re all - me included, of course - making a fundamental mistake. Failures know a lot about failure, sure. But knowing failure is completely different from knowing success. Fixing your mistakes doesn’t mean success takes their place - you’ve just got a point to start at, is all. That’s something failures don’t understand.;;;;;;;;
87;(La Corda D'Oro - primo passo);Kahoko Hino;"""If you close down the way to your own path, it will always open up. That's why this isn't a song of ending. It is a new encounter. A song of beginning.""";;;;;;;;
88;(Wolf Girl & Black Prince);Erika Shinohara;I really do like you. You pissed me off, so I considered giving up for a minute, but I'd never lie about my feelings. So I won't quit. Even if you don't believe me now, I'll keep saying it until you do! I'll keep trying! This isn't over!;;;;;;;;
89;(Shirobako);Yumi Iguchi;Better to ask and be a fool once than never to ask and be a fool forever.;;;;;;;;
90;(Fairy Tail);Makarov;There is great value in the time spent in ones own company, but a life time of total isolation is a fate no one should endure.;;;;;;;;
91;(Whistle!);Shō Kazamatsuri;I won't be defeated because I know how awful it feels to lose after doing my very best!;;;;;;;;
92;(Berserk);Guts;If you're alone... if it's just your life, you can use it however you please/ Wear yourself out, get cut to ribbons, doesn't matter. But when there's two, the blade grows heavy. Fighting like death doesn't concern you becomes a thing of the past. It's no longer just you. I threw away my way of life, relied on the strength of others, and somehow pushed on.;;;;;;;;
93;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Takano Miyo;Every phenomenon that happens in the human world is caused by people for their own convenience.;;;;;;;;

98;(Tamako Market);Kunio Yaobi;There are times like that music can convey more than words. ;;;;;;;;
99;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;Trying to improve by learning from others that is what calls friendship.;;;;;;;;
100;(Eureka Seven);Charles Beams;Freedom is something that you need to actively acquire. It's not something that's given with no strings attached. To be free means to take responsibility, and to prepare yourself for what's to come.;;;;;;;;
101;(Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e);Kiyotaka Ayanokouji;All people are nothing but tools. It doesn't matter how it's done. It doesn't matter what needs to be sacrificed. In this world, winning is everything. As long as I win in the end...That's all that matters.;;;;;;;;

103;(Boku no Hero Academia);All Might;It's not bad to dream. But you also have to consider what's realistic. ;;;;;;;;
104;(Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records);Glenn Radars;Humans are creatures that always get hurt and feel regret whenever they make a choice on something. ;;;;;;;;
105;(Psycho-Pass);Rikako Oryo;This epidemic leads innocent people to their deaths, and yet it's pathogen will never be eradicated. This is a disease called serenity, a form of death that people have wished for.;;;;;;;;

107;(Koe no Katachi);Shouya Ishida;Things would have been so much better back then... If we had heard each other's voices. I hate myself. I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else's feelings. Since then, my classmates have all looked down on me. I've lived for seventeen years, and I haven't lived one of them as a good person. The only time I heard your voice was when we got into that fight. And what pisses me off the most is the fact that I haven't changed at all since back then! But.,. But now, I think I can understand what you were saying... Nishimiya. Me and you... Can we be... friends? Shit!! I went way too far!! I was just gonna apologize and get out of here! Why the hell did I end up asking her to be friends?... Why did I even say that?! Jeez, that's so embarrassing! How can you even say that? ;;;;;;;;
108;(Koi to Uso);Takasaki Misaki;Just your touch... gets me excited. It makes me so happy. But those feelings will all turn into pain. The happier I am now, the more it'll hurt. I know how cruel this is... but no matter how hard I try, I can't rid myself of this. Nejima-kun... I... don't know... what love is.;;;;;;;;
109;(Nanbaka);Uno;*to Jyugo* You're such a gloomy Gus, aren't you? You're so gloomy, indecisive, and so pessimistic. You're also dull, have bad handwriting, can't learn, insensitive, weak, a slow runner, a poor talker, and a poor liar. You really can't do anything other than break out of jail. Also you have short legs. But... that means you have lots of character traits, right? That's all you need to know for now, don't you think? If you don't know something, we'll teach you. We're gonna make your life more fun. It doesn't matter whether we're in jail or hell. If we live happily, we win. So let's take it slow and make sure you'll enjoy tomorrow.;;;;;;;;

111;(Koi to Uso);Nejima Yukari;Even though you like someone already, your partner is decided for you... and you can't do anything about that crush.

112;(Nanbaka);Uno;There's more to a real man than just his good looks!;;;;;;;;
113;(ReLIFE);Yoake Ryou;If I'm going to disappear no matter what, I at least want to leave them having fun and smiling.;;;;;;;;
114;(Koi to Uso);Nisaka Yuusuke;"If you take someone at puberty, a teen... introduce him or her to a member of the opposite sex around the same age and say, ""This is the person who was meant for you""... and then go on to spend a lot of time together... why wouldn't you fall for them?";;;;;;;;
115;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;I want you to please understand the scales of my heart will always be swaying back and forth. But there is something you should know. I will never lean to one side or the other due to the weight of gold coins.;;;;;;;;
116;(ReLIFE);Onoya An;Even though everything is going to disappear, it isn't supposed to be meaningless. It's exactly because you know you're going to part ways, that now and only now is your only chance.;;;;;;;;
117;(Koi to Uso);Takasaki Misaki;I don't really want you to understand... I just don't want you to be like, 'Oh, is that all'? I don't need people to get it. These feelings... are important to me, and they're just for me.;;;;;;;;
118;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Akasaka Ryuunosuke;It's a programmer's job to make the most of limited resources to turn an impractical idea into reality.;;;;;;;;
119;(Nisekoi);Maiko Shuu;Making sure I have no regrets... that would just be self-serving, nothing more. It's all right. I mean, this is a great memory in itself, right?;;;;;;;;
120;(Isshūkan Friends);Yūki Hase;There are things I don't want to forget... Memories of time spent with friends. Memories of time spent with her alone. Memories are important. But there's something even more important... That's to continue making memories.;;;;;;;;
121;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;I have no fear of watching you grow old while I remain young. I'll even watch you on your death bed. I am no stranger to death. But your heart is like that of an innocent child. It has always accepted everything about me, without hesitation. Because of that I am very afraid.;;;;;;;;
122;(Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!);Kazuma Satou;"I yearn for true gender equality. I have no patience for one who talks about female privilege when it suits them, and then complains about someone ""not being a man"" when it's convenient.";;;;;;;;
123;(Nisekoi);Ichijou Raku;But... If you're the kind of person who can devote herself like that to someone, then I'll bet you anything there's someone out there who'll fall in love with you.;;;;;;;;
124;(Isshūkan Friends);Shougo Kiryuu;Yeah, if I saw her smiling to herself while reading this, I might think it was creepy. But there's something wrong with people who talk trash and laugh behind another's back, too.;;;;;;;;
125;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;Stop pouting! You learned something valuable. Remember the lesson, not the disappointment.;;;;;;;;
126;(Nisekoi);Ichijou Raku;You're right. Whether I ever see that girl again or not, that doesn't change the fact that this promise is important to me. I'm gonna go on treasuring it.;;;;;;;;

129;(Koi to Uso);Takasaki Misaki;What is love?;;;;;;;;
Its when your eyes start following someone;" and you look for them if they’re not around. You get excited thinking you might run into him when you’re putting your shoes on in the morning. And when you don’t it’s a little disappointing. But then you pass by him and that makes you happy for the rest of the day. It feels like you can handle anything. Seeing him is enough to make you happy.""";;;;;;;;;;
130;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;I do not want to wake from my dream and discover that I am all alone. I am tired of being alone! I do not want to be cold! I do not want to be lonely!;;;;;;;;

132;(Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records);Celica Arfonia;The ones who accomplish something are the fools who keep pressing onward. The ones who accomplish nothing are the wise who cease advancing.;;;;;;;;

137;(Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!);Megumin;Explosion!!!;;;;;;;;
138;(Kakegurui);Jabami Yumeko;The only one who can decide your worth.. is you. If you want to earn something, you need to reach out for it. Pro-athletes give up their teenage years to train. Business owners put up collateral to borrow money. That's how it always works. To make your ambitions come true, you have to take risks. The larger the ambition the greater the risk. That might involve time or enough work to affect your lifespan... So make your choice. Live in peace as a wannabe or risk losing it all to reach the very top. You're the one who needs to decide.;;;;;;;;

141;(Kakegurui);Jabami Yumeko;The amount of money one owns ultimately decides the victor. This doesn't stop within the walls of a casino, or it's cash flow. It's a rule that forms the basis for a capitalist society!;;;;;;;;

144;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Takeshi Yamamoto;Enjoy your life today. Yesterday is gone, and the tomorrow might never come.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
147;(Whistle!);Shō Kazamatsuri;Why do I want to win so much...? Everyone takes up soccer for different reasons. But we all have a passion for the sport... That drive carries us through a game, even if we lose. If we win, it pushes us forward to the next game. The winners of the game honour the losers by playing with everything they have... and until we hit a wall, until a better team beats us, we should try our best, instead of running away. That's what I want to do!;;;;;;;;
148;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;"I want to reply with a long message, but if it's too long, that might be kind of revolting. But if it's too short, then I might come off as cold instead. Feeling apprehensive of what to do, I decided to reply back with a similar word count instead. This was what they called ""mirroring"" in psychology. By emulating the actions of the other party, your affection levels would increase!";;;;;;;;

150;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;If what I wished for was granted to me, if what I wanted was given to me. Then, as I thought, I wouldn't wish for anything nor want anything. Because the things you were granted and the things you were given were surely shams that would one day be lost. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
The things you wished for had no shape and the things you wanted were untouchable. Or possibly;" they might be the most wonderful treasures that would become nothing if you were to touch them. """;;;;;;;;;;
151;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;It' because you were embarrassed, frustrated, bitter, and jealous. If there's a time when those ill feelings surfaced, then there's also going to be a time where you restrained yourself, smiled, and then cut your relationships afterwards.;;;;;;;;

Being aware of your eventual break up was a rather complicated thing. If you wanted to graduate with a smile;" shouldn't you avoid approaching your friends too much? And that's where having no friends was super convenient!""";;;;;;;;;;

154;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;To realize a mistake. To not lie. To love one another. To not kill. Those are very simple things, but these times won't allow for them. There is no green on this planet, even though we want it... though we want it so badly. A place where we can live peaceful days with no wars nor stealing. A sacred place where people can live as people. Yes there, that place is called Paradise.;;;;;;;;
155;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;Compared to failing without even trying, I'd rather take action, even at the risk of a mistake.;;;;;;;;
156;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;No matter what you're doing, the most essential thing is to not give up. Fail as many times as it takes. Keep trying persistantly untill you can call yourself 'avarage'. If you can collect a nice group of avarage-level skills, that's already above-avarage. You've created your own sort of 'talent'.;;;;;;;;
157;(Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records);Glenn Radars;"It's easy to say ""choose so that you'll have no regrets,"" but that's impossible. No matter how hard you've agonized over your path, you'll always regret something about it later. That's just how we humans are made. Which is why I think our true feelings are important. If you choose your path based on your true feelings, it'll hurt just a little less when you feel the same regret, right?";;;;;;;;
158;(Octave);Yukino Miyashita;"Someone told me this: ""Nothing is ""forever"" in human relationships"". That might be true, but it sounds awfully lonely. But I realized today... If there really is no such thing as ""forever""... Then having someone important is the happiest thing one can attain in life.";;;;;;;;

164;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Kruger;There is no such thing as truth in this world. That is our reality. Anyone can become a God or a Devil. All it takes is for someone to claim that to be the truth.;;;;;;;;

169;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru.);Hachiman Hikigaya;Well it's not like the world is full of sunshine and daisies. If society was only shaped by the view that one must be happy-go-lucky all the time, Hollywood wouldn't make tear-jerking movies, would they? ;;;;;;;;
170;(Hanamonogatari);Rouka Numachi;"There isn't anything that's evil to everyone. Even the worst evil saves something. On the other hand, even the greatest good hurts someone. The phrase ""There are no absolutes in this world"" means there isn't any absolute good or absolute evil.";;;;;;;;
171;(Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge);Tanaka;Being angry consumes energy and makes me tired. So I'd rather apologize, even if I'm not at fault. Besides, we get along, and we both want to stay friends. Prolonging an awkward situation out of stubbornness is just silly.;;;;;;;;
172;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;You're absolutely right. I can't do anything alone.  Everyone has their flaws and imperfections, but that's what drives us to work together... To make up for those flaws. Together, we make the perfect main character. ;;;;;;;;

175;(Boku dake ga Inai Machi);Satoru Fujinuma;"Every day, the words cross my mind.  ""If I had done this back then..."" but they don't take the sincere form of regret.  The words are just an excuse that come to my mind then disappear.";;;;;;;;
176;(Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda.);Sakagami Takumi;I'd talk, but... I fell into the habit of not saying what I really felt, somewhere along the way. And then I started believing that there wasn't anything... that I really wanted to tell anyone.;;;;;;;;
177;(Nekomonogatari: Kuro);Meme Oshino;"It's not like people only look for help by saying ""please help me."" In similiar vein, it's not like you're only in love with someone if you say ""I love you."" Everyone has things they can't say on impulse.";;;;;;;;

180;(Koe no Katachi);Shouya Ishida;I intended to listen to your voice, but it really was nothing but intentions. It's pretty obvious, huh? Of course there's more going on than what people choose to tell you... But I convinced myself that was all there is to a person. I knew that, but still I interpreted the stuff I didn't understand about you in ways convenient for me... That's just how I am.;;;;;;;;
181;(Haikyuu!! Second Season);Tooru Oikawa;Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, or next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think that it will never come, it probably never will.;;;;;;;;

186;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;For a pregnant woman to give birth, she's gotta feel the pain of pulling a watermelon out of her nostril. For an Artist to create a masterpiece, he's gotta feel the pain of pulling entire galaxies out  of his ass.;;;;;;;;
187;(Isshūkan Friends);Shougo Kiryuu;You can only become friends by talking to people and finding out whether you get along.;;;;;;;;
188;(Bungou Stray Dogs 2nd Season);Osamu Dazai;Anything I would never want to lose is always lost. It is a given that everything that is worth wanting will be lost the moment I obtain it. There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.;;;;;;;;
189;(Citrus);Mei Aihara;The two of us aren't so different. My whole life I've desired from others. I felt bitter to the people around me and I closed off my heart...and a heart that lets nothing in..will become empty before you realize it. But in this world, you'll sometimes meet meddlesome people who will, even without asking, give you the love you need. And for someone like you or me, meeting such a person is very blissful.;;;;;;;;

202;(Senki Zesshō Symphogear);Chris Yukine;And the one person who I thought understood me was just using me all along. No one ever treated me as an equal. Adults are all trash. They didn't listen when I said that it hurt. They didn't listen when I told them to stop. They didn't listen to anything I said!;;;;;;;;
203;(Bleach);Kyouraku Shunsui;That’s just the way it is. Change is inevitable. Instead of resisting it, you’re better served simple going with the flow.;;;;;;;;
204;(Bungou Stray Dogs 2nd Season);Osamu Dazai;Man fears death and yet, at the same time, man is drawn to death. Death is endlessly consumed by men in cities and in literature. It is a singular event in one's life that none may reverse. That is what I desire.;;;;;;;;

223;(Shingeki no Kyojin: Before the Fall);Kuklo;All the people I saw from my cage...All the things I saw from my cage, that was the whole world to me. At first, all I could sense was the hostility of the people looking at me from outside...And their feelings of fear. Piercing gazes, hurled stones, whips, sticks...Everything outside the cage was frightening, a source of pain...But eventually I began to realize something. I began to see their other emotions, not just their hostility and fear of me. They were the emotions of families, lovers, and friends who came to the sideshow...Emotions meant for each other.;;;;;;;;

But neither Orihara or Shizuo had any secrets whatsoever.  And that resulted in the complete opposite kind of personal relationship.;;;;;;;;
227;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;You are fighting out of obligation, not out of hatred. You will never reach me like that. Battle without hatred is like a bird without wings. You’ll never defeat anyone like that. You powerless friends are just weights that will break your legs. ;;;;;;;;

238;(SERVAMP);Johannes Mimir Faustus;i'm on a little boat. I'm going against the current of the river, downstream to upstream. If you want something more, you move forward with all your might. If you try to stop, you fall behind. Humans can never stop moving. If they do not yearn for something... Right! Nothing begins without action! You gain nothing if you do nothing! Satisfaction is stagnation! Stagnation is death! I want to know! See! Feel! Experience! Understand! This monster is amazing, but we know nothing about him! This monster strength was amazing.

People will never attain the hope that is to be found from casting their fears aside and preserving through them. While it is true that people can continue to press forward through the simple act of living... That is no way comparable to marching forward in the face of death, while doing their damndest to keep it at bay. That is why... That is why people have given that very march a unique and special name. ""COURAGE.""";;;;;;;;

278;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Shinohara;I understand the pain of losing a comrade. I've experienced it, too. Please do not forget the pain. You will move forward while holding on to that pain. Please treasure the comrades you have now. Once they are gone, they will not return. Usually, you don't realize this until afterwards.;;;;;;;;
279;(Vinland Saga);Thorkell;I'd had fifteen years to think about him. And I realized that it wasn't a matter of the life or death of flesh. What's important to a warrior is the soul...And where it lies.;;;;;;;;
280;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;Surely there must be limits to which one may sink. ;;;;;;;;
281;(Vinland Saga);Canute;The world...God's divine creation...Is so brimming with love...Yet there is no love in the hearts of men.;;;;;;;;
282;(Vagabond);Takuan Sōhō;Live on and endure the shadows! There is no light for those who do not know darkness.;;;;;;;;
283;(Noragami);Hiyori Iki;If you're in a position to save people, you should never even joke like that. My father...The doctor...Would never abandon anyone. He'd never give up on a person's life, even if they tried to throw it away.;;;;;;;;
284;(Durarara!!);Shizuo Heiwajima;Look, you.  All this talk about monsters...that's what people have called me ever since I was a kid.  I've snapped and lost sight of everything around me, and I've made trouble for Celty more than once or twice.  Even so, she still heard me out, without interrupting.  And so now it's my turn to hear her out, all right?;;;;;;;;
285;(Vinland Saga);Leif Ericson;Not all warriors fight on the battlefield with a sword in hand. A sailor makes his living battling the sea;;;;;;;;
286;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Hayashi;The more battles we fought, the more our confidence grew. We weren't afraid of anything back then. But the difference between victory and defeat is paper-thin. We didn't realize this and were arrogant.;;;;;;;;
287;(Kaiji);Hyoudou Kazutaka;Kings do not become kings by themselves. If the poor raise up together, declaring that they don't want any money, kings will be overthrown. However, poor seek money so that they can become kings themselves. Which in turn only strengthens the position of the current king.;;;;;;;;
288;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;You brake the law and I'll punish you, there is no room for discussion. ;;;;;;;;
289;(Ore Monogatari!!);Makoto Sunakawa;Studying is for people to get the knowledge they need to not screw up in life.;;;;;;;;
290;(One Piece);Fujitora;If you were to be troubled over something as trivial as losing face, then it's better to not have it at all.;;;;;;;;
291;(Vinland Saga);Canute;Where in this world can a sane man be found? We're the same. We're all the same. None of us understands what it means to love all. Or the meaning of life...Or the meaning of death...Or the meaning of our own battles.;;;;;;;;
292;(Guilty Crown);Gai Tsutsugami;The world offers up a choice to live or die. The survival of the fittest that's the only governing law this world recognizes.;;;;;;;;
293;(Gakkou Gurashi!);Yuki Takeya;There are days when nothing goes right. There are days when you stumble and fall. There are days when you just want to cry. To cry a lot. To sleep a lot. Or even eat a lot. It's alright, as long as you pick yourself up again.;;;;;;;;
294;(Torikago no Tsugai);Shirasagi Yuki;I believe that people have the individual right to decide how they want to live. So whether you just listen to what others say, or get stuck a lot of times...and cause trouble to others, it ultimately comes back to yourself.;;;;;;;;
295;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;I know we can't immediately treat her as part of our group, but if we always think of her as an outsider, she'll never have a chance to become part of our group.;;;;;;;;
296;(Whistle!);Mizuno Tatsuya;That kid's good point is that he feels he doesn't have much skill. It's this kind of person that will keep on improving.;;;;;;;;
297;(Noragami);Bishamonten;If you hurt me, then so be it. Do you think that there is any human in all the world who has never hurt another? You are all so kind...It hurts you to hurt others. That is why I had been hiding my pain, as well.;;;;;;;;
298;(Vinland Saga);Askeladd;Only those who do their jobs on the battlefield get the rewards they desire. That's the life of a warrior.;;;;;;;;
299;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;Being strong isn't just about having power or move, it about one's spirit;;;;;;;;
300;(Vagabond);Matahachi Hon'iden;No matter how many years it's been since they met, brothers are brothers, aren't they? Even without having seen, I can tell.;;;;;;;;
301;(Prince Of Tennis);Kintarō Tōyama;If your failing, then keep trying until you don't.;;;;;;;;
302;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;Even if there's nothing here today, there might be something tomorrow.  It's a caring heart that's important.  ;;;;;;;;
303;(Log Horizon);Nyanta;People...At least, all children are born into a world that seems unreasonable and crazy to them. No one is asked at birth if they agree to come into the world. Everyone is born that way.;;;;;;;;
304;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Erwin Smith;Humanity will never stop fighting itself.. until it shrinks to a size of one or fewer.;;;;;;;;
305;(Durarara!!);Shinra Kishitani;These days, I feel more comfortable in dark places.  I look at these shadows as a part of you.  They absorb all the light.  There's no one in the world who has this color but you. ;;;;;;;;
306;(Vinland Saga);Thors;You have no enemies. No one...Has any enemies. There is no one...That you should hurt;;;;;;;;
307;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;It doesn't matter what you were like before. Nobody cares.;;;;;;;;
308;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Brittany;Living has it own challenges. I'll give you just one piece of advice. Don't quit. Yes, when you die, you die. But if you give up, you're definitely going to die. That, I am sure of.;;;;;;;;
309;(Paprika);Atsuko Chiba;You're fat, slow and sloppy. It's not the outside that counts, but there's a limit to that too.;;;;;;;;
310;(Ghost Hound);Makoto Ōgami;Sometimes the person who tries to keep everyone happy is the the most lonely one.;;;;;;;;
311;(Log Horizon);William Massachusetts;A man's come all the way out to the end of the North to ask for my help. Wouldn't it be rude to wait to hear what he wanted?;;;;;;;;
312;(Tokyo Ghoul:re);Karren von Rosewald;The sorrows of life...To not be able to live like yourself. The joys of life...To be able to die like yourself.;;;;;;;;
313;(Vinland Saga);Askeladd;You're young. Time is on your side. You'll grow up and I'll grow old. Someday you'll likely beat me. It's only natural. Even the strongest man must die.;;;;;;;;
314;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;The present isn't everything, but there are things you can only do now, things you can only find here. ;;;;;;;;
It's now or never. Think; Writhe; Struggle and agonize. If not;" what you are going through isn’t genuine.""";;;;;;;;
315;(Adventures of Sinbad);Rurumu;Smile. Even if you're facing an enemy, people can't attack others with a smile.;;;;;;;;
316;(Durarara!!);Shizuo Heiwajima;Look, all it means is that when I lose it, it's cause things make no sense.  If there was any logic to it, then I wouldn't get pissed even if I got shot or stabbed.  ;;;;;;;;
317;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;You mongrels. By our next meeting see that you've culled your numbers. Only a true hero is worthy to look upon my glorious presence. ;;;;;;;;
318;(Vinland Saga);Askeladd;A fight you can't win becomes an obsession;;;;;;;;
319;(Fairy Tail);Gajeel Redfox;You taught me what it means to love, and for that I will be eternally grateful.;;;;;;;;
320;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Manato;I'm the one who is grateful. That's because you're all willing to be my friends. For that, I'm grateful.;;;;;;;;
321;(Durarara!!);Shinra Kishitani;He may seem cold-blooded, but he's more human and his heart is more brittle than anyone else... so much so that if you filled it with human love or betrayal, it'd break easily... which is why I think he chose to avoid it all from the start: to love humanity. Do you understand? Not to accept it, not to face it, but he chose to avoid it.;;;;;;;;
322;(Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls);Carly Stratmann;They don't know that once you lose something, you can never get it back again.;;;;;;;;
323;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Bors Elder;We've never worked together before, so don't worry about teamwork! Just stay out of each other's way. Fight the way you want to fight!;;;;;;;;
324;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Ranta;I'm a man who makes precise choices about time, place, and people. Pleople call me Master of Choices. I'm gonna be the King of the Choices!;;;;;;;;
325;(Bleach);Haschwalth Jugram;Even if doesn't alter or change the end result in the slightest, making decisions based on convictions that you believe in and walking your own path has its own merit and worth. There's something to be said for not having... even one regret.;;;;;;;;
326;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mr. Blouse;Those who don't fulfill their obligation to others 'ave no right to ask 'em for such privilege...;;;;;;;;
327;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Ouka Kashima;I don't want to be a loser who can't do anything but talk. I don't want to be somebody who can sacrifice others, but won't risk himself.;;;;;;;;
328;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Barbara;If you have enough breath to say you don't have energy, I haven't push you far enough!;;;;;;;;
329;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Mia Grand;When you're just starting out, put all your energy into surviving. No matter how pathetic you feel, or how people laugh at you, if you come back alive, you win.;;;;;;;;
330;(Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance);Gendou Ikari;People live on by forgetting their memories. But there are some memories that should never be forgotten.;;;;;;;;
331;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Kubota Yoshinobu;I understand now... What I really need to protect isn't myself, much less my money. It's my pride.;;;;;;;;
332;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;As for me, I have a lot of things that I'm not good at and that I need to work on. My comrades make up for those weaknesses by help me out, and maybe that's how we've found a balance in our party.;;;;;;;;
333;(ReLIFE);Yoake Ryou;If someone always follows the perfect path without ever facing hardship... Is it really what's best for that person?;;;;;;;;
334;(Noragami);Yato;Life and death are like light and shadow. They're both always there. But people don't like thinking about death, so subconsciously, they always look away from it.;;;;;;;;
335;(Vinland Saga);Thors;The only reason I must rely on this sword is because I am imperfect. A true warrior...Needs no sword;;;;;;;;
336;(The Gamer);Hwan Sung-Gong;Tell me, if you have something more important than your life, and you have to give up your life to protect that, what would you do? In that case, isn't there only one answer? Give up your life.;;;;;;;;
337;(Suicide Island);Sei;Right now, we're all really only taking it day by day. Even if we can't get used to things, even if we can't win at something, even if we don't have any excess...In order to live day by day, we work, we fail, and we succeed. Sometimes we laugh. For the blessing before our very eyes, for our friends, we're thankful. Who knew that people could feel happiness just from living?;;;;;;;;
338;(Mobile Suit Gundam Wing);Trowa Barton;I've continually fought, and with each battle I've been killing my own heart. And my heart has been completely void of feeling for quite a long time now. Maybe my life doesn't have value anymore, but I have to keep on living. ;;;;;;;;
339;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;If you keep on hiding your true feelings, who is going to be happy? If you are sad, you should say it out loud!;;;;;;;;
340;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;If you don't face each other with honesty, what kind of family is this?;;;;;;;;
341;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Marlowe Sand;They'll learn that a man without reason is no different from an animal who defecates wherever it pleases.;;;;;;;;
342;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;Once the thread of fate is tangled, it cannot be undone.;;;;;;;;
343;(Mobile Suit Gundam Wing);Heero Yuy;I can't stand the weak, They're always nervous about when they might next be attacked. They can't trust anybody and they never have an opinion of their own. I can't stand such people.;;;;;;;;
344;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Ymir;Living this way is my way of getting revenge!! I'm going to be living proof that your fate isn't decided at birth!! So what about you?! You're going to kill yourself, the ultimate act of submission. Is that how much you want to please the people who treated you like a nuisance?! Why are you trying to hurt yourself?! If your will is that strong... Then shouldn't you be able to change your fate?!;;;;;;;;
345;(One Piece);Sengoku the Buddha;Don't try to find a reason for somebody's love!!;;;;;;;;
346;(Vinland Saga);Askeladd;A man, slave to gold, holds a whip...And beats the slave he bought with that gold as if to claim HE is the master. He just doesn't see it for himself. Every living human being is a slave to something;;;;;;;;
347;(Jitsu wa Watashi wa);Akari Koumoto;Love is more afraid of change than destruction.;;;;;;;;
348;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Ymir;Just because you want other people to think of you as someone who'd literally die for another... dragging someone else to his death just for that... only a bad girl would do that, right?;;;;;;;;
349;(Code Geass: Akito the Exiled);Shin Hyuga Shaing;Belief in others is an illusion concocted by the clever to exploit the stupid.;;;;;;;;
350;(Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge);Tanaka;The weather's nice and the breeze feels good. The little birds are making their cute chirping sounds. Perhaps people nowadays have forgotten how wonderful nature is... Yes, don't you think it's a waste to not feel it with your entire body like this? ;;;;;;;;
351;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Hange Zoe;Even in moments of the deepest despair... I guess we can still find hope, huh?;;;;;;;;
352;(Super Lovers);Kaidou Haru;But... When I lost the whole foundation of my happiness in one instant, I realized that I was the biggest coward in the world.;;;;;;;;
353;(Koutetsujou no Kabaneri);Biba Amatori;We humans are miserable creatures. We reject what we fear. We attack because we don' t understand. Human cowardice... breeds war.;;;;;;;;
354;(One Punch Man);Saitama;If you really want to be strong... Stop caring about what your surrounding thinks of you!;;;;;;;;
355;(Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls);Annie Leonhardt;All day, I've had to sit in the stench of cigarettes and alcohol. Every single person I met today was drinking and smoking. If they weren't, they were doing drugs. Well, except for Wayne. I've... had enough of it.;;;;;;;;
356;(Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls);Annie Leonhardt;Sometimes you have days like this. Days where the most trivial little thing... Ends up getting you wrapped up in some big, annoying trouble.;;;;;;;;
357;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;(To Ichigo Kurosaki) You are a fool, Ichigo Kurosaki. You willingly seek to challenge an opponent so much more powerful than you that it strikes a primal fear into your being. Incomprehensible. If this is the work of the 'heart' that you people speak of, then it is because you possess this 'heart' that you humans bring hurt upon yourself, because you possess this 'heart' that you lose your lives;;;;;;;;
358;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Hange Zoe;Even if all we accomplished were small steps forward... We continued to give our lives if it meant that one day... humanity would be free from this terror.;;;;;;;;
359;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Annie Leonhardt;Going against the flow... takes a lot of courage. I respect that. Maybe people who can do it are just stupid, but... Well... What I'm sure of is that people like that are rare. So you can't call them common. You can't call them normal, either. People like you... get called special.;;;;;;;;
360;(One Piece);Usopp;Man or Child, Strong or Weak, None of those matter once you are out at sea!;;;;;;;;
361;(The Heroic Legend of Arslan);Kubard;The world won't always go the way you want it to. Better not take it to seriously.;;;;;;;;
362;(The Heroic Legend of Arslan);Arslan;The one who holds power has no self-awareness of his responsibilities and the one aware of the responsibilities has no power at all.;;;;;;;;
363;(The Heroic Legend of Arslan);Arslan;Zealotry and prejudice more than anything, bring harm to the people of the land.;;;;;;;;
364;(Naruto Shippūden);Madara Uchiha;Love is not necessary, power is the only true necessity.;;;;;;;;
365;(Magi - The Labyrinth of Magic);Goltas;The chains of fear are easily broken with the blade of courage.;;;;;;;;
366;(Magi - The Labyrinth of Magic);Hakuei Ren;To force obedience by the sword now will only invite bloody rebellion later.;;;;;;;;
367;(Fist of the North Star);Kenshiro;The  pain on these wounds will last only a second. The pain of your death would last a lifetime.;;;;;;;;
368;(Gantz);Gantz;The Killer instinct is not perceived by words, but by look;;;;;;;;
369;(Gantz);Kei Kurono;Yeah, so I don’t appear to be the brightest crayon in the box but I still look down on the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;
370;(Aoi Bungaku Series);Takada;Still I've never thought of myself as an unfortunate person. Of course I am not a fortunate person either. In the first place a fortunate person could never write plays or novels. I write while loving my misfortune almost as if I'm tasting it.;;;;;;;;
371;(Monster);Wolfgang Grimmer;You can't just erase people's feelings. It's as if my emotions were lost somewhere hundreds of miles away. It's as if they were sent long ago, in a letter that was always intended for me.;;;;;;;;
372;(Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Zetsubou-hen);Junko Enoshima;Hope is harmony. A just heart, moving toward the light. That is all. Despair is hope's polar opposite. It is messy and confusing. Despair swallows up love, hatred, and everything else. Because not knowing where you will end up is despair. Despair is what even you cannot predict. Only despair's unpredictability will save you from a boring future.;;;;;;;;
373;(Shiki);Nao Yasumori;My new family is just so kind. It's almost if there's been some kind of mistake... like, I'll have to pay back for all this happiness later on.;;;;;;;;
374;(Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls);Annie Leonhardt;What must be done... Must be done. No matter what. Complete your mission. You were born into this world so that you could complete your mission.;;;;;;;;
375;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;Even if they're only a year older, shouldn't we respect and serve our elders?;;;;;;;;
376;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;It seems like we spent a long time together, but it wasn't. It was actually pretty short. Too short. So I kind of know, but I kind of don't know what I want to say. He was friendly, easy to talk to, and smart. He could do anything and was reliable. I thought he was perfect. But maybe I just didn't realize what his faults were. He might have been hiding his flaws.;;;;;;;;
377;(Vagabond);Miyamoto Musashi;Pray not for the future. Rely not on the future or the past. Just stay in the Now.;;;;;;;;
378;(Hunter X Hunter);Pariston Hill;Normally, as people love and are loved, they feel happiness. When I am hated by people, that is when I feel happiness. And then I want to tear apart and inflict unimaginable harm to the things I love. But is that really all that strange, I wonder?;;;;;;;;
379;(Naruto Shippūden);Itachi Uchiha;I actually don't think something like perfection exists. That is I think why we are born able to absorb things... and by comparing ourselves with something else we can finally head in a good direction.;;;;;;;;
380;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Hidehito Nomura;I think I finally understand... As long as there's someone who'll grieve, it's wrong to want to die.;;;;;;;;
381;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Ranta;So now we know her past. So what? It doesn't have anything to do with us. We have to be nice to her just because she's had a rough past? You've got to be kidding.;;;;;;;;
382;(One Punch Man);Sweet Mask;A hero must be tough, strong and beautiful... As well as able to promptly and splendidly eradicate evil.;;;;;;;;
383;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;So long as I don't give up, the possibility of winning will never fall to zero.;;;;;;;;
384;(No Game No Life);No Game No Life;This blank space represents infinite potential. One day, it may become anything.;;;;;;;;
385;(Gekijou-ban Kyoukai no Kanata -I'll Be Here- Mirai-hen);Yayoi Kanbara;Youmu or Spirit Warrior... In the end, none of that really matters. Nor does the question of who you are. All that matters is to be close to the ones you care about. ;;;;;;;;
386;(Hunter X Hunter);Killua Zoldyck;People only find me interesting because they can't tell whether I'm serious or not.;;;;;;;;
387;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;Nobody knows what will happen in the future. Something even better might happen tomorrow.;;;;;;;;
388;(The Gamer);Han Jee-Han;If you ask what life is to me, I'd answer endless days of homework and pain. Why you ask? The amount of homework, it's too much.;;;;;;;;
389;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;Mankind is a very intresting species.;;;;;;;;
390;(Naruto Shippuuden);Madara Uchiha;People cannot show each other their true feelings. Fear, suspicion, and resentment never subside.;;;;;;;;
391;(Owarimonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;Even if mistaken, even if cruel, even if stupid, if many people acknowledge it, I found out that it can become the right thing. I found out that righteousness was able to be infinitely mass-produced. I found out that righteousness was established by the number of people. I found out that maneuvering for a majority was everything.;;;;;;;;
392;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;Those painful memories are what help us make it to tomorrow and become stronger.;;;;;;;;
393;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Bell Cranel;I can't forgive myself. I wanted something to happen without doing anything myself! I have to do it. I have to do it all... Or I can't even stand by her side!;;;;;;;;
394;(Shokugeki no Sōma);Arato Hisako;If there's something you want to go through with, you should stick to it without keeping up appearances.;;;;;;;;
395;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Hayabusa Shou;I'm here because I don't like to be tied down. So you should decide for yourself who you want for your friend.;;;;;;;;
396;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Ranta;Why do we have to be okay being friends with someone who won't treat us as friends?;;;;;;;;
397;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Ryu Lion;Humility is a virtue, but do not insult yourself.;;;;;;;;
398;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;(To Ichigo Kurosaki) Do not allow yourself to be shaken. Do not weaken your stance. Open your senses. And do not let your guard down for an instant.;;;;;;;;
399;(Soul Eater);Crona;I hate, hate, HATE everyone. But that’s okay. I can use my screams to blow them all away. I’m sure dead people are a lot easier to deal with.;;;;;;;;
400;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Fukase;Don't you think forcing people to help with something pointless is far more cruel?;;;;;;;;
401;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;You have yet to see what form your soul has taken. That's what it actually means when you claim that you lack joy in your life.;;;;;;;;
402;(No Game No Life);Tet;What do you think about your world? Is it fun? Is it easy to live in?;;;;;;;;
403;(Dragon Ball Super);Goku Black;I am looking at things from a much higher perspective than you. I observe this world, this universe, the truth of all things. And I have come to realize that humanity must be destroyed. Out of all which the Gods have made, humans are their sole failure. They are a disease that must be vanquished. A filth that must be cleansed. They have no place here, in this universe, and if I am to make it a utopia once more, then I must take upon the grand task of removing humanity forever, in place of the Gods who refuse to admit their mistake.;;;;;;;;
404;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;You said that she's no different from us, right? So if we don't try to get to know her, she won't try to get to know us either. If we don't treat her as a friend, she won't treat us as her friends either, right?;;;;;;;;
405;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;When you aim to reach high places, you may find yourself on narrow footing and feel disheartened. And then your confidence will falter, and you will find it ever harder to believe in yourself. If you ever feel that you can't believe in yourself, please believe in your friends.;;;;;;;;
406;(Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda.);Sakagami Takumi;Well, singing, or music... I think by nature it was always meant to convey something. So if there's something you want to say, don't you think you should try singing it?;;;;;;;;
407;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Marco Bodt;You're not a strong person, so you can really understand how weak people feel. I mean... Most humans are weak, including me... But if I got an order from someone who saw things like I do, no matter how tough it was, I'd do my damnedest to carry it out.;;;;;;;;
408;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Ranta;We should be driven by things like our desires, instincts, and impulses. That's how it should be.;;;;;;;;
409;(Pandora Hearts);Xerxes Break;No matter how much despair awaits them, I wish that at the end of their story, the gentle light of hope will shine on them...;;;;;;;;
410;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Fukase;Looking back on the past is a dangerous thing. It's nothing more than an attachment.;;;;;;;;
411;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;After today, tomorrow will come again. Maybe I've been taking that for granted. But now... It's not easy, huh...;;;;;;;;
412;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Reiner Braun;There are times we can't run away, no matter how bad the odds are. When the people we're supposed to protect are threatened, we have to enter the fray and shield them. And it doesn't matter who or what the enemy is. We need to master skills and get stronger, with artillery as well as hand-do-hand combat. I think that's our responsibility as strong soldiers.;;;;;;;;
413;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Eina Tulle;Listen, girls like guys who are strong and can protect them. So if you keep working hard and get stronger, she just might like you back.;;;;;;;;
414;(Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda.);Naruse Jun;Don't tell people to disappear like it's nothing! Words can hurt people! You can't ever take them back! Even if you regret it, you can never take them back!;;;;;;;;
415;(Hetalia The Beautiful World);France;The government is the sails, the people the wind, and the time the sea. As long as there is people to repair the ship, it can be used forever.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
417;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Manato;Everybody has things they aren't good at or can't do. We cover each other's weakness. That's what a party's for.;;;;;;;;
418;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;You're only resorting to physical abuse because you can't prove that I'm wrong.;;;;;;;;
419;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Hestia;In the end, guilt is just the question of whether you're capable of forgiving yourself or not. If you've really changed, then prove it with your actions.;;;;;;;;
420;(Haikyuu!!);Tooru Oikawa;If you think too hard when you don't have a brain, you're going to hurt your head.;;;;;;;;
421;(Boruto: Naruto Next Generations);Naruto Uzumaki;The many lives lost during long years of conflict... because of those selfless sacrifices, we are able to bathe in peace and prosperity now. To ingrain this history within the new generation will be a vital cog in helping to maintain the peace.;;;;;;;;
422;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;At times, you will probably lose sight of your life goals, as well. When that happens, instead of panicking, why not try indulging in a hobby? Then a new, or perhaps an old, goal might grow stronger, and stronger, into a rousing fortissimo.;;;;;;;;
423;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;The lesson you need to learn right now, can't be taught with words... only with action.;;;;;;;;
424;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;Are our enemies the kobolds? No, our real enemies are our overly weak selves.;;;;;;;;
425;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Bell Cranel;I wanted to save you because you're you. I didn't want you to leave, because you're you. I can't find another reason. I don't need another reason to save you.;;;;;;;;
426;(Haikyuu!!);Tooru Oikawa;If you're gonna hit it, hit it until it breaks!;;;;;;;;
427;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;All of the Arrancar follow me... because they see me as fearless and the only individual who can actually bring forth the new world... the new future where you can belong. Without me, that dream can't be fulfilled and without me the gotei 13 will destroy you all...  Do you see it now from my point of view?;;;;;;;;
428;(The Last -Naruto the Movie-);Rock Lee;A hero is not the one who never falls. He is the one that who gets up, again and again, never losing sights of his dreams.;;;;;;;;
429;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Hayabusa Shou;If I have to win through underhanded means, I'd rather just stand right here until I die.;;;;;;;;
430;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Ranta;Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll only tire yourself out.;;;;;;;;
431;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;I think there are times people have to die... even if I don't like it.;;;;;;;;
432;(Alderamin on the Sky);Ikta Solork;If you think unconditional kindness is good, and any sort of kindness that comes with conditions is hypocrisy, you should reconsider. People can only achieve as much as the situation allows.;;;;;;;;
433;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Hephaestus;Don't make yourself weigh your pride against your friends.;;;;;;;;
434;(Bungou Stray Dogs);Atsushi Nakajima;After being driven out of the orphanage, I had nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, and, as one might expect, not a cent to my name. Yet, I lack the courage to commit theft. That is how I've arrived at my current predicament... However... if I wish to live, I have no choice but to steal and take from others!;;;;;;;;

436;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Edward Elric;There's no such thing as a painless lesson, they just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary, you can't gain something without losing something first... Although if you can endure that pain and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle... Yeah... A Fullmetal Heart.;;;;;;;;
437;(ReLIFE);Hishiro Chizuru;Maybe worrying about the future partings so much that you miss out on happiness in the present is a waste.;;;;;;;;
438;(Bungou Stray Dogs);Osamu Dazai;A good book is always good, no matter how many times you’ve already read it.;;;;;;;;
439;(The Gamer);Han Jee-Han;Adults say you shouldn't do things half-heartedly. But in reality, you can get by with doing just that. Of course, it would be great to stand out. But how many people can live like that? It's really hard to be exceptional.;;;;;;;;
440;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;When faced with a decision... At such times, we must choose only one option and it can be very confusing. When that happens, simply using your head and charging straight into the obstacle is a fine option.;;;;;;;;
441;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;A lot of the times, you're going into a situation you know nothing about. So what you need is to be quick to act... and make tough decisions in worst-case scenarios.;;;;;;;;
442;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;I now have things that I don't want to forget, and things that I shouldn't forget. And I don't plan to ever forget those things, as long as I live.;;;;;;;;
443;(Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata);Tomoya Aki;When an otaku goes all-out with his mind set on something you better not underestimate him.;;;;;;;;
444;(Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka);Bell Cranel;If I don't stand up here... If I don't reach higher here... When am I ever going to do it?;;;;;;;;
445;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;The fact that you consider yourself as an equal to me, is being arrogant in itself.;;;;;;;;
446;(Akatsuki no Yona);Zeno;I might be the ugly duckling of the group, but I'll make sure that I'll protect all of you with all my might.;;;;;;;;
447;(Akatsuki no Yona);Yona;I know that I have no strengths to offer. It irritates me how weak I am. But let me protect them!;;;;;;;;
448;(Kingdom);Riboku;The purpose of an alliance is not simply for the sake of preventing an enemy from attacking you. Rather, importance lies in what one can obtain after the alliance. As well as your actions after the alliance.;;;;;;;;
449;(Fairy Tail);Makarov Dreyar;Now listen up, any power that surpasses reason, still comes from reason, right? Magic isn't some kind of miraculous power. It is a talent that only works when the flow of energy inside of us and the flow of energy in the natural world are in perfect synchronization. To perform magic one must have a strong mind and the ability to focus. It should take over your being and come pouring out of your soul! If all we do is worry about following rules, then our magic will never progress.;;;;;;;;
450;(Fairy Tail);Mirajane Strauss;No matter how hurt someone is, they're meant to overcome it and try to go forward.;;;;;;;;
451;(One Piece);Fujitora;If you lose credibility by just admitting fault, then you didn't have any in the first place. ;;;;;;;;
452;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Mary;There are wounds that even magic can't heal, but... even though it was painful to hear you talk about it, it was okay. That part was okay.;;;;;;;;
453;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;Accomplishing a shared goal under tense circumstances causes distance between people to naturally close.;;;;;;;;

456;(One Punch Man);Saitama;Prophecies don't ever come true.;;;;;;;;
457;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Manato;If you guys weren't here, I don't know what would have happened to me. You can't live in this world alone, no matter how you look at it.;;;;;;;;
458;(Sakamoto desu ga?);Sakamoto;If you have no money, I believe all you can do is work.;;;;;;;;
459;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;Someday we'll part. Maybe be forgotten. But we're living in the moment. So... make lots of friends, fall madly in love, and enjoy every moment to the fullest.;;;;;;;;
460;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;That's right... This world... is cruel. It hit me that living was like a miracle.;;;;;;;;
461;(One Punch Man);Saitama;"Heroes and the police don't do their jobs because someone says ""please"". Right?";;;;;;;;
462;(Hai to Gensou no Grimgar);Haruhiro;If we had spent more time together, maybe I would have seen another side of him. I wish I knew him more. I wish I knew more about what kind of person he was. I wanted more time. If we had more time, we would've gone through things together. Maybe we would've gotten annoyed at each other and fight. Maybe we would've disliked each other, or liked each other more.;;;;;;;;
463;(Hunter × Hunter);Netero;Ant king , you believe I cannot pray with a single arm? A prayer comes from the heart. If the heart achieves the correct form, it becomes emotions and emotions can be manifested.;;;;;;;;
464;(One Piece);Dracule Mihawk;My name is Dracule Mihawk! Find your self, true world, become stronger! No matter how long it may take, I will wait for you in my strongest form! Surpass this sword! Surpass me! Roronoa Zoro!;;;;;;;;
465;(The Gamer);Han Jee-Han;What use is strength in modern society? You have to be smart.;;;;;;;;
466;(Tokyo Ghoul:re);Kaneki Ken;Donato has to keep proving himself. He wants to prove just how valuable he is. Isn't that the case with you as well? Because you are the same as Donato. All you're doing is indulging in this twisted self-value that you have to yourself. And if you don't, you won't last. Eventually, you will break and become useless. Once that happens, you'll break and become discarded.;;;;;;;;
467;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;I wont stop fighting when im tired, i'll stop fighting when you've shattered my heart into a thousand pieces  ;;;;;;;;

474;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Usui Haruaki;I no longer pay attention to other people’s skills. It doesn’t matter;;;;;;;;
475;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Hange Zoe;Ever since I joined the survey corps, I've had people dying on me everyday. But... you understand, don't you? One day or another, everyone you care about eventually dies. It's something we simply can't accept. It's a realization that could drive you insane... It's painful... so painful... I get it. And still... we must keep moving forward.;;;;;;;;
476;(Sword Art Online II);Konno Yuuki;Sometimes you have to fight to get your point across.;;;;;;;;
477;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;This silence belongs to us... and every single person out there, is waiting for us to fill it with something.;;;;;;;;
478;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;But being optimistic isn't a bad thing, is it? It's not like you're doing anything bad. It's also not like you're cheating either.;;;;;;;;
479;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Shindo Iroha;"One can evoke ""extraordinary"" abilities if one focuses all energy on just one point.";;;;;;;;
480;(Skip Beat!);Kyoko Mogami;I would no longer fight against my feelings because I realized how useless and ineffective it was to fight them. ;;;;;;;;
481;(Owari no Seraph);Mikaela Hyakuya;The vampires don't really care about humanity in general. It's only specific humans like you that concern them... The kind of humans who will stop at nothing to acquire more power.;;;;;;;;

485;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru Episode 8: Twilight of the...);Frederica Bernkastel;Humans are pitiful beings, walking forward their backs to the future gazing at the past. This is why they fail to notice the simplest pitfalls and stumble tragically and comically.;;;;;;;;
486;(Haibane Renmei);Reki;There is no such thing as forever. Everything ends sooner or later. Just as it should. Because now is only now. And this moment... is so precious.;;;;;;;;
487;(Owari no Seraph);Mikaela Hyakuya;In the end, the best way to live down here is to be smart. You've got to be clever to survive.;;;;;;;;
488;(Nisemonogatari);Suruga Kanbaru;It's easy for girls to take advantage of your kindness, so be careful.;;;;;;;;
489;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Otonashi Maria;There’s no despair that can’t be overcome by everyday life.;;;;;;;;
490;(Chihayafuru);Taichi Mashima;It doesn't seem right to let a girl choose me. I would rather choose the girl I devote myself to.;;;;;;;;
491;(Haikyuu!! Second Season);Ittetsu Takeda;Birds with the wind in their wings are flying across the great blue sky right now. And all of you should be able to make it! To the highest limit, to the farthest limit!;;;;;;;;
492;(Nisemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;The impostor is an impostor because it can't be distinguished from the real thing. The proof of its falsity is in its resemblance to the real thing.;;;;;;;;
493;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Shindo Iroha;The purpose of practice is to improve your power. The purpose of the real race is to win.;;;;;;;;
494;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;Sometimes people put up walls, not to keep others out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
496;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Hoshino Kazuki;I believe that love is much deeper than that. It’s much more irreversible. It exceeds just caring for each other and continues until both parties become entangled and inseparable. They combine to form a single concept. They become one. Neither of them must come apart. THAT’S LOVE.;;;;;;;;
497;(Toradora!);Sumire Kanō;Haven't you already lifted your foot, preparing to step forward? Then you only have one option! Finish taking that step! ;;;;;;;;
498;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;Being rivals does not mean being an enemy.;;;;;;;;
499;(Three Days of Happiness);Kusonoki;You appearing before me was the best thing that’s ever happened in my life. The worst was when you left my sight. …And depending on your reply now, I might have a new best or worst.;;;;;;;;
500;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Usui Haruaki;"""Because I won’t die if I miss."" I can totally understand the words of that slugger. We won’t die just because our dreams and efforts prove futile, nor do we need to despair. We both faced much greater despair, so we aren’t afraid of the obstacles that lie before us. We can easily bet on a coin flip while others are too frightened to even pick heads or tails.";;;;;;;;
501;(Tabi ni Deyou Horobiyuku Sekai no Hate Made);Girl;"The three pleasures of life are ""eating"", ""bathing"" and ""sleeping""!!";;;;;;;;
502;(ReLIFE);Hishiro Chizuru;The more fun I have, the more it'll hurt when we part ways. I know that all too well.;;;;;;;;
503;(Three Days of Happiness);Kusonoki;However happy or sad something is, you’ll soon forget it if you don’t get a chance to recall it. What people don’t realize is that they’ve forgotten about forgetting. If everyone really preserved the happiest memory from their past perfectly, they’d only be sadder living in their relatively hollow present. And if everyone preserved the worst memory from their past perfectly, well, they’d still be sad. Everyone just remembers what it’s inconvenient not to remember.;;;;;;;;
504;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Otonashi Maria;Do you know why you are making the mistake of sacrificing yourself? It’s because you’re weak. It’s because you can’t face reality.;;;;;;;;
505;(Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo);Odagiri Nene;Why can't I steal him from her? There are no rules in the game of love!;;;;;;;;
506;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;Studying is important, but I think love is too. It's the last summer of high school. It's a precious time that won't come again.;;;;;;;;
507;(Three Days of Happiness);Kusonoki;Re-explaining my memories through words made good memories easier to savor, and bad memories easier to accept.;;;;;;;;
508;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Otonashi Aya;Giving people what they want only results in temporary delight, and that you can only make a select few people happy that way.;;;;;;;;
509;(Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo);Miyamura Toranosuke;Girls' hearts are reflected by their underwear's color...!!;;;;;;;;
510;(ReLIFE);Yoake Ryou;Fight with all your might. With those young kids, give your mind and heart a solid workout. Let your heart, which had dried up and gotten stiff, beat once more.;;;;;;;;
511;(Three Days of Happiness);Miyagi;There can be no going back once you come to love someone.;;;;;;;;
512;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Otonashi Maria;Cry when you’re sad. Laugh when you’re happy. Get angry when you don’t like something. Depend on someone when you’re depressed. Care for yourself before you care for others. Don’t hate anyone. Be proud of yourself. Stay loyal when you fall in love.;;;;;;;;
513;(Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo);Yamada Ryū;Is there some rule that says I have to give up just because I was rejected?!;;;;;;;;
514;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;"Please, let that iron guard down for a minute. It's only hurting you. I know when you've hit rock bottom, people trying to cheer you up can be really annoying. ""What would you know?"" ""Just leave me alone."" But what if someone you're pushing away is really worried about you? That'd be a shame.";;;;;;;;
515;(Three Days of Happiness);Kusonoki;I’d rather have my physical pain exceed my mental pain than the other way around. By hurting myself just enough, I could turn my attention to that.;;;;;;;;
516;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Hoshino Kazuki;If I abandoned you, I would be released from this pain. I would live on. But before long, I would end up seeking you again, for all my actions are ultimately devoted to you and only you. All I want is to stay on target and walk straight ahead—ignoring the losses and opposition, and even the results. That’s all I can do. Some people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a miracle—but to me and many others, my driving rationale couldn’t be more obvious and natural. There are people who understand this and there are people who don’t, and I simply happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they have noticed that they don’t need boxes to make their wishes come true, and what it means to fulfill a wish. My commitment to find you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it’s easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I’m only really alive when I’m touching the fragment of you that I carry within me. Even if I don’t reach you in the end… Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits me… I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria. I’m going to vanish. Maybe I’m getting my just deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn’t, I would always pick the former. Always. I’m sure of that, even though I may be hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time. I will not have accomplished anything by the time I vanish, and I’m certainly not mature enough to say that I can accept that. Even now, I’m still dreaming— …that my efforts might be rewarded with some kind of happy ending.;;;;;;;;
517;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Hoshino Kazuki;Life has no weight in itself;;;;;;;;
518;(Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo);Sarushima Maria;Knowing what's in store for me means I have nothing to look forward to. If I know something good's going to happen... then when it does, I'm only half as happy about it because I knew in advance. And then when I know something bad is going to happen... when it does, I get overwhelmed with this sense of defeat... and feel even worse.;;;;;;;;
519;(Tokyo Ghoul);Touka Kirishima;After you've gobbled him down you'd be left alone to regret it while covered in blood and guts. That's the hunger of a ghoul. That's our destiny.;;;;;;;;
520;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;But there's something a little sad about them [fireworks], too. They're so flashy, pretty and exciting, but as they fade, you feel sort of lonely.;;;;;;;;
521;(Terror in Resonance);Five;You should just steal the things you want.;;;;;;;;
522;(Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo);Yamazaki Haruma;You can erase the memories, but you can't erase the feelings behind them.;;;;;;;;
523;(Bokurano);Tanaka Misumi;When surviving today is so simple and matter-of-fact people tend to forget. They forget what it means to eat a pig. They say all life is equal, but how much life is consumed to keep them alive everyday?;;;;;;;;
524;(Tokyo Ghoul);Renji Yomo;All we can do is live while losing things.;;;;;;;;
525;(Princess Tutu);Edel;Truth is a shy little thing. If you approach it, it will hide. Truth is a lonesome little thing. If you move away from it, it will give chase.;;;;;;;;
526;(Sword Art Online II);Konno Yuuki;It's okay to live, even if there's no greater point to living.;;;;;;;;
527;(Bleach the Movie: Hell Verse);Inoue Orihime;People are all evil. In order to falsely believe yourself to be just, you must inevitably falsely believe that someone else is more evil than you.;;;;;;;;
528;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;As my fingers and toes re-grew like fingernails or hair over and over and over and over... and over again, every single time I got the feeling that I truly, truly truly was a monster.;;;;;;;;
529;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Edward Elric;No matter how big the place is, we'll eventually reach the edge if we keep moving forward!;;;;;;;;
530;(ReLIFE);Hishiro Chizuru;I don't understand what I say that makes people so mad. I don't understand how they feel. I know that's because I haven't properly socialized, I've tried to learn. I've tried to study up on it, but I just don't know what's right.;;;;;;;;
531;(Denpa Kyoushi);Shikishima Kiriko;Getting kicked out of school won't kill me, but losing my way of life most certainly will.;;;;;;;;
532;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;Never trust anyone too much, remember the devil was once an angel.;;;;;;;;
533;(Terror in Resonance);Nine;Falling is just another way of flying.;;;;;;;;
534;(ReLIFE);Ooga Kazuomi;I thought that without you, everything would be so boring. The idea of someone else touching you... was just not okay. I only realized this recently. But I think... I've loved you for a long time, too.;;;;;;;;
535;(SERVAMP);Tsubaki;It's not that I don't trust you all. It's the opposite. I'm going because I believe in you all. You all know this well, right? No matter who betrays me, I won't betray anyone.;;;;;;;;
536;(Boku no Hero Academia);Eraserhead;They've been exposed to the outside world, up close and personal. They've had that fear planted in them. And they've endured it. Overcome it. Each has grown from that experience... and forgotten how to hesitate.;;;;;;;;
537;(ReLIFE);Yoake Ryou;I think it's a good thing, you know. You're paying attention to those around you. You don't just notice, you take action to help. I think it's one of your strength. But don't you wonder? Is getting rid of all the thorns in someone's path really what's best for them? While they're still young enough to be allowed to trip and fall, it's important for them to learn the pain of it and how to pick themselves up again.;;;;;;;;
538;(SERVAMP);Watanuki Sakuya;"I don't want to lie anymore. The words ""I believe in you"" is a curse. No, it's a spell. If the one who hears it feels cursed, they are.";;;;;;;;
539;(Boku no Hero Academia);All Might;The slight difference between those who always aim for the top and those who don't... It'll come to matter in a big way once you all emerge into society.;;;;;;;;
540;(Mondaiji-tachi Ga Isekai Kara Kuru Sou Desu Yo?);Izayoi Sakamaki;I'm not only allowing my comrade to continue to their deaths but I will also follow her footsteps. It's clearly a show of irresponsibility... But those that did not even intend to take the responsibility in the first place can only be called cowardly and despicable.;;;;;;;;
541;(ReLIFE);Ooga Kazuomi;I can't just leave a crying girl alone and go home. I'm too wimpy to carry you, but I can lend you a shoulder, and get you down the stairs.;;;;;;;;
542;(SERVAMP);Lawless;You don't know anything. What the hell is up with you? Trying to be the hero? Feel like some all-powerful main character? So annoying! Why? When? Where? What? How will you do and just who will you become? You're just pretending by spouting your ideals! You have nothing! You won't become someone. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
545;(ReLIFE);Saiki Michiru;Knocking others down to gain an advantage is a fruitless endeavor. It means they've given up on winning any other way.;;;;;;;;
546;(ReLIFE);Kaizaki Arata;You're just too busy comparing yourself to others to see. Those comparisons aren't the only measure. Don't say it's all pointless. You've work hard and made yourself better. That's what you got in return. So don't put yourself down like this.;;;;;;;;
547;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;Yeah, I'm being stupid.  I know that it's out of question. I know how this will end. I'll be left with nothing.  Even so, I want us to think, writhe, struggle... and find... [something genuine].;;;;;;;;
548;(Mondaiji-tachi Ga Isekai Kara Kuru Sou Desu Yo?);Izayoi Sakamaki;Not taking the initiative to secure your future but just waiting for luck to come your way, wasn't that just the definition of being lazy?;;;;;;;;
549;(Rurouni Kenshin);Enishi Yukishiro;The only atonement you will ever realize will be that of you're own death. You will be justly and severely punished, before you ever find the peace you seek Kenshin. That is the meaning of 'Jinchū'. Those who live must act in the place of those who have died. YOU ARE A CRIMINAL SO DIE LIKE ONE! I will make you suffer and scream, you took my sister... You destroyed her happiness... SUFFER KENSHIN, DIE! YOU MISERABLE DOG!!;;;;;;;;
550;(ReLIFE);Hishiro Chizuru;I want to defeat the me that's dragging this failure around. I don't want to forget my failure. But if I carry it with me as a bad memory and keep running away, I will never change.;;;;;;;;
551;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Just as stand users attract other stand users, loners seems to have an ability to attract other loners as well.;;;;;;;;
552;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;However far I fall as long as there's so much as a thread left I will use it to climb. I'll take hold of it. I refuse to give up while I'm still human I can do that much. But every person must decide on his own whether to grab it.;;;;;;;;
553;(Date A Live);Izayoi Miku;"Even if I lose my ""voice"". Even if everyone else doesn't turn up to hear me sing — as long as you're there, then, that's enough. If it comes to that… I will sing, just for you.";;;;;;;;

555;(07 Ghost);Frau;If you don't believe in history... Just believe in the world you see with your own eyes.;;;;;;;;
556;(Shakugan no Shana III);Khamsin Nbh'w;It's still a form of love. To those with the emotion of love, acts of rebelling, anger, cursing, fighting, and killing do not work in contradiction to that emotion. Rather, too strong a love could quicken them. What the other wishes is not all there is to love.;;;;;;;;
557;(Rokka no Yuusha);Adlet Mayer;In order to accomplish something, first you had to believe in yourself that you could do it.;;;;;;;;
558;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;Just because you die... doesn't mean that the people you killed will come back to life... instead using this sword to save just one more soul is repentance in true sense. ;;;;;;;;

If you want to know how I felt about the complete ban on some culture and art that I could not understand, was not interested in, or could not accept, in the name of preventing the violations of others’ rights or other trumped up charges, I believe that would be taking us onto the road of discriminating against others. If we define culture as that which is healthy or humane, and defend that decision in the name of justice, once any part of that system collapses, it will cause an unimaginable number of problems for society. For instance, if I drew a line in the middle and erased one side, the next day, a new line will appear in the middle of the side that is left.

Imagine, when you find a rainbow, when you found a shooting star, when you found a cafe you like, when your change is 777 yen or something. If it's Raku, it's fine to imagine the first time a leaf stood up in your tea. When you found a beautiful sunset, or if you found your taste in music, or if you win a pretty good prize in the lottery, those small things in everyday life.

687;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Rem (re:zero);When you said that you hate yourself, it made me want to tell you all the wonderful things I know about you.;;;;;;;;
688;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;Do exactly as you like. That is the true meaning of pleasure. Pleasure leads to joy and joy leads to happiness. Your path is now clear, Kirei. So clear there is no longer any need to hesitate.;;;;;;;;
689;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Historia Reiss;There are many ways of thinking as there are people.;;;;;;;;
690;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;So don't be afraid to open your hearts to others. It's pointless to keep testing people. All you're doing is hurting yourselves.;;;;;;;;

694;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;I have a dream at last. The butterfly trapped in spiderweb has no wings. That butterfly is... me.;;;;;;;;
695;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;Stop living in the past like an old man.;;;;;;;;
696;(Haikyuu!!);Ittetsu Takeda;"Is ""defeat"" proof that you are weak? Isn't ""defeat"" more like a trial to overcome? Of whether you can stand up and walk again after falling to you knees? If you remain on your knees like that, then it would be a sign of weakness.";;;;;;;;
697;(Monster);Wolfgang Grimmer;As long as we are under the same sky, we shouldn't be sad when we part ways.;;;;;;;;
698;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Korosensei;What does it feel like, having your own death right before your eyes? That grand kaleidoscope glimpsed in the moments before death... What could be flashing through that perfect mind of yours?;;;;;;;;
699;(SERVAMP);Shirota Mahiru;What is an adult? Does coolly drinking black coffee and spouting logic make you an adult?! If that's the case, I'll stay a kid that likes drinking orange juice.;;;;;;;;
700;(Orange);Naruse Kakeru;If you endure too much, it'll be your loss.;;;;;;;;
701;(Log Horizon);Shiroe;If you're going to give up that easily, we have no hope.;;;;;;;;
702;(SERVAMP);Shirota Mahiru;If I'm bad at doubting others, I'd rather believe in them! If I get tricked, I'll think about what to do when it happens! Things are simpler that way!;;;;;;;;
703;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Karasuma Tadaomi;"""Every experience is a tool to clear your path."" It was none other than those students who taught me that.";;;;;;;;
704;(Koutetsujou no Kabaneri);Ikoma;We are weak Mumei. But, that doesn't mean we just roll over and accept our fate.;;;;;;;;
705;(Assassination Classroom);Karasuma Tadaomi;If something is possible, carry on as planned. Even if it isn't possible, do it anyway.;;;;;;;;
706;(Fate/stay night);Gilgamesh;If a couple curses stopped me, what kind of hero would I be?!;;;;;;;;
707;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Asano Gakuho;Well I do have abilities you haven't yet been given, just like not everyones has the strengths you do.;;;;;;;;
708;(Koutetsujou no Kabaneri);Ikoma;Look. Look at me! Watch as the man you cast out spills his blood and dies. Take a nice long look! I will save you all. I want you to live the rest of your lives knowing the man you abandoned saved you. And I will laugh at you from the afterlife. And tell you that it serves you right!;;;;;;;;
709;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;To kill is an action which overflows in everyday life. In actuality the more you try to be accepted, the more you kill your unrestrained self.;;;;;;;;
710;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Korosensei;I study too, you know. How could I teach anyone if I didn't grow and learn day by day. Now let's get rid of this dangerous cloth. Experiencing my Absolute Defense Form over summer vacation taught me yet another skill: compressing not my whole body, but a portion of my tentacles to release a burst of energy. Remember this Itona, I say assassination is education. The assassination classrooms teacher will get stronger every time he teaches!;;;;;;;;
711;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious commodity than the wisdom of the masses? There are those who were born human but harbor wishes that man was not meant for and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit.;;;;;;;;
712;(Sailor Moon);Sailor Chibi Moon;Just 'cause you're a girl, it doesn't mean you have to wait for a prince to come along on a white horse. You can go out and find Prince Charming yourself. It is up to you to find the right boy.;;;;;;;;
713;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;There are two kinds of arrogance. One where you are unequal to the task and one where your dreams are too big. The former is commonplace stupidity... but the latter is a rare species that is difficult to find.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
717;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;The night is in its darkest just before dawn. But keep your eyes open. If you avert your eyes from the dark, you'll be blinded by the rays of a new day. So keep your eyes open, no matter how dark the night ahead may be.;;;;;;;;
718;(Akagami no Shirayukihime);Zen Wistalia;Red is supposed to be the color of fate, right? Even if it’s annoying now, it might connect to something good when you least expect it.;;;;;;;;
719;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Death is like being born, but backwards. It only hurts for a little while, then a new life begins. A life with no sorrow, no pain, a glorious new beginning. A beginning that will last an eternity.;;;;;;;;
720;(Nani made nara Koroseru);Reika;How far can you kill? Things like ants, spiders, and other bugs, we can squish without much thought, right? But if it's a fish, we feel a little reluctant when killing it. We begin to feel pressures of taking a life. It gets worse if the fish is replaced by an amphibian, and even more so if the amphibian becomes a reptile. The pressure is worse if the reptile becomes a bird, and even worse when the bird becomes a mammal. The higher up the chain we move towards the more advanced creatures, the more we hate to kill them. And eventually we hit a hurdle too high to overcome. We're unable to kill anything beyond that point. I think the highest hurdle would be... people.;;;;;;;;
721;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;That's right. It's not like I ever felt superior to anyone else because I could see ghosts. And I never planned to take it up as a profession. Hell, I never even felt the need to use my ability to help others. All I ever wanted was the normal life I couldn't have. I've finally achieved what I always wanted.;;;;;;;;
722;(Ga-Rei:Zero);Tsuchimiya Kagura;In a real fight, there is no next time. You can't choose your opponent's strength. Losing would mean death. If a duty-bound person dies, a hundred more innocent people would die. We exorcists cannot die easily, and that is a responsibility.;;;;;;;;
723;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;No matter whether you win or not, there's no meaning to war.;;;;;;;;
724;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;You give up your future, lose your dream, are stained with despair... yet at the same time, you shake off you past, fight reality, and never lose your nobility.;;;;;;;;
725;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Joey Wheeler;My treasure... you can see it, but you cannot! So I can´t show it to you! It´s friendship! We can see it in each other, but you can't see courage itself, right?;;;;;;;;
726;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;Death is to good for trash like you. This is your punishment which is even harder than death. Atone for your sin by living... A life of fulfillment.;;;;;;;;
727;(Gintama);Gintama;A prison, you say? You think you'll be free if you go to the world above? A girl like you can never be free no matter where you go. After all, we humans are apes put in a cage called Earth. There is no difference between the world above and the world below. The only difference is which is bigger or smaller. People who pout about how confining the cage is can never be happy. They live their lives only seeing the iron bars. A true lack of freedom is when you cage your soul.;;;;;;;;
728;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);The Will of the Whole Misaka Network;Relationships do not always improve... Sometimes they decline... But... it still counts as a victory if it all works out in the end... Let’s keep it at that...;;;;;;;;
729;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;"Don`t you... decide everything by yourself!! I don`t care about being pathetic or getting anything in return... People cannot possibly choose their own birthplace, but they can choose their own death that's why I became a ""Code Breaker"".  I`ll burn down all evil as long as I`m still alive... to the very last second of my life... nothing more than that!!";;;;;;;;
730;(Kingdom);Ei Sei;Every single one of them died while furiously giving off the light that resided within them and that light is then inherited by the next person where it will go on to shine with an even greater radiance. And thus people are connected together... allowing us to work towards a better tomorrow. ;;;;;;;;
731;(Koi Dano Ai Dano);Momoka Hanai;People struggle to find an answer even in things like math where there is clearly only one answer. So there's no shame in struggling through something that has no right answer. ;;;;;;;;
732;(Gintama' TV 2012);Gintoki Sakata;Will you choose that ticket and live on as a man? Or will you choose this one and go back to being a woman? No matter what you choose, I'm sure you will continue to waver. But what's wrong with that? Manly? Womanly? Are those random values that others made up really what you were striving toward? If things were so clear cut, then neither men, women, you, or me would be leading such painful lives.;;;;;;;;
733;(SERVAMP);Shirota Mahiru;"I was curious. Mikuni-san and Tsuyuki-senpai are the same. You say you'll ""destroy"" vampires. You never say ""kill"". Senpai. You've never seen a vampire playing games while lazing around the house, have you? A vampire crying that they're ""sorry for lying"" and regretting... A really bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met too! I've seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They're all my comrades. You know, it'd be good if you just talked about what's bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons to want to protect or save something. If they find C3 is weakening, the balance between humans and non-humans will collapse. If we suffer major damage from Tsubaki's side and asked you all for help, can you guarantee that none of the other vampires would attack C3? I don't really know... what the situation between vampires and C3 is, but, simply put, we need to protect it all, so that nobody gets hurt!";;;;;;;;
734;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Ichigo Kurosaki, all of the battles you've fought, were all part of my plan.;;;;;;;;
735;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;I dislike things. When a person dies, their things are left behind. I`d like to take care of mine ahead of time.;;;;;;;;
736;(Makai Ouji : Devils And Realist);Dantalion;Always the same... Every age, every generation. Human beings are infinitely more cruel and selfish than any demon in hell.;;;;;;;;
737;(Inu X Boku SS);Karuta Roromiya;Eating together makes food taste better and makes friends grow closer. ;;;;;;;;
738;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;Even when the answer’s obvious, making one wait for it is the worst thing you can do.;;;;;;;;
739;(Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou);Rachnera Arachnera;"So you're trying to accept everyone and their feelings, aren't you? I think you already know this, but if you keep trying to do this ""accepting"" thing with everyone, you're liable to be torn to bits. ";;;;;;;;
740;(Vagabond);Miyamoto Musashi;There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.;;;;;;;;
741;(Kuroshitsuji);Vincent Phantomhive;Love is a magnificent thing but, incidentally, it can also give birth to dreadful tragedy.;;;;;;;;
742;(Kiznaiver);Hisomu Yoshiharu;If you don't know what state you wounds are in, of where you're hurting if you don't know that for yourself, there's no point in trying to share it with others, is there?;;;;;;;;
743;(Kiznaiver);Maki Honoka;There is nothing more expensive than something free.;;;;;;;;
744;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Subaru Natsuki;I finally remembered why I'm here to begin with. I'll kill you, you shitbag! I won't let you play your trump card! I'll blow you away and get a happy ending.;;;;;;;;
745;(Ao Haru Ride);Kou Mabuchi;We want the ones we can't have and ignore the ones that want us but then, we end up with none in the end.;;;;;;;;

747;(Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry);Kurogane Ryouma;If you have the guts to not give up,you can be anything you want to be.We're living creature that don't have wings, but still went to the moon.;;;;;;;;
748;(Tower Of God);Twenty-Fifth Baam;"Those who try to step over someone else and go up higher... are actually only running away from some fear that they cannot see. Trying to step over someone is an cowardly action. It means you're not confident enough to face the opponent and speak to them with the same viewpoint. It doesn't matter how much power I have in me. By using that ""power"" that's taking over you. I do not want to become such a cowardly person. I will fight and get hurt in order to survive....";;;;;;;;
749;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Miyuki Shiba;Wiping out any and all injuries as if they never happened. A spell like that... Do you really believe he can cast it without paying any price? In order to rewind the Eidos changelog and make a full copy,the stored information must be read in its entirely. Needless to say, that includes the pain and suffering experienced by the injured party. Not only that, but it's transmitted instantaneously in condensed form. For example, from the time that Isori was injured until brother cast his spell, roughly 30 seconds had gone by. Whereas the time Brother spent reading the Eidos changelog... was approximately 0.2 seconds. In that blink of an eye, my Brother's mind felt 150 times the pain and suffering experienced by Isori, condensed. Everytime Brother heals someone's wounds, that is the price he pays. Do you really mean to say that he should still use that power for others?;;;;;;;;
750;(Cowboy Bebop);Faye Valentine;You know the first rule in combat? [Empties sub-machine gun through closed door] ... shoot them before they shoot you.;;;;;;;;
751;(Cowboy Bebop);Londes;The souls that God has given us, our spirits. Our spirits, which found a way to swim through the immense network and live in the infinity of space. Is not the human body a mere shell? A form of existence all too small and weak for consciousness with such vast reach and potential.;;;;;;;;
752;(Fairy Tail);Minerva Orland;Power is not the only connection you can have.  This world is filled with much warmer things.;;;;;;;;
753;(Ergo Proxy);Kazkis Hauer;All those who wander in the darkness seek the light, but when they reach the light, they turn away their eyes from the blinding glare.;;;;;;;;
754;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);C.C.;In their heart, everyone has faith that their victory exists. However, in the face of time and destiny, the act of faith is fruitless and fleeting at best.;;;;;;;;
755;(Da Capo II);Jihou;Everyone becomes an adult by learning how to give up on things.;;;;;;;;
756;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);C.C.;In this world, evil can arise from the best of intentions. And there is good which can come from evil intentions.;;;;;;;;
757;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;I must spill yet more blood, so the blood already split will not be in vain.;;;;;;;;
758;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Magata Shiki;Of course. Humans can be kind because there are things they do not understand. If they knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.;;;;;;;;
759;(Bleach);Ginjo Kugo;Time will try to constantly try to catch up with you. And with a roar, it will overcome you. Do not look ahead. Hope only lies within the unforeseeable current that will close in from behind.;;;;;;;;
760;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Magata Shiki;I think I would like someone else to kill me. I want someone else to interfere with my life. Is that not what wanting to be loved means, Saikawa-sensei? No life is born of it's own volition. Isn't the instinctive desire of beings, born not of their own volition, for their lives to be taken in the same way?;;;;;;;;
761;(Haikyuu!!);Tanaka Saeko;There are some flowers you only see when you take detours.;;;;;;;;
762;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Souhei Saikawa;"Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, ""Am I really the same person I was yesterday?"" For example, just as a computer loads its OS into memory and boots up each time it restarts, is it possible I'm just booting up the person called ""Saikawa Sohuei"" each morning and trying to play that role?";;;;;;;;
763;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;Do you know what a scientist fears most in this world above all else? It's oblivion, my friend. A scientist measures our lives in the ways we develop and expand our knowledge through myriad variations. Nothing can take its place. It's our very soul. I have done the worst thing one scientist can do to another: I have altered your thought process. When my drug takes effect, you will find your mind has lost the ability to think.;;;;;;;;
764;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Souhei Saikawa;Seeing nature and thinking it's beautiful is what's unnatural. That means the life you lead is an unclean one. If you can cut yourself off from mother nature and still survive, doesn't it mean you have enough inner beauty to allow you to do that?;;;;;;;;
765;(Sakurako-san no Ashioto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru);Isozaki Itsuki;Listen. Right now, you're trying to shoulder someone else's life. That might be the right thing to do, but that act requires a lot of resolve. It'll become a thorn that can't be removed, and it'll continue to hurt you forever. The briar will continue to grow, but it'll never flower. It'll only hurt, it'll only cause you pain.;;;;;;;;
766;(Ghost Hunt);Mai Taniyama;Forget him. Forget his name. Forget his face. Forget his kiss, his warm embrace. Forget the love that you once knew. Remember he has someone new. Forget him when they played your song. Remember you cried all night long. Forget how close you once were. Remember he has chosen her. Forget how you memorized his walk. Forget the way he used to talk. Forget the things he used to say. Remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh. Forget his grin. Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight. Remember he's with her tonight. Forget the time that went so fast. Forget the love that moved, it's past. Forget he said he'd leave you never. Remember he has gone forever...;;;;;;;;
767;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Ryōhei Arisu;Just as water can overfill a container. Madness is all the same.;;;;;;;;
768;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Subaru Natsuki;All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, all the pain I felt, all the fighting I did with my life at stake... And my reward was her name and a single smile. Jeez... Talk about unequal compensation.;;;;;;;;
769;(Bleach);Riruka Dokugamine;"If you ask anyone to name a universal rule that governs animals and humans alike, I bet you most people would answer ""survival of the fittest"". There are strong people and there are weak people. At a glance, it looks like the difference is pretty clear-cut. But the truth is, there's a lot more to it than just a simple battle of ""strong"" against ""weak"", of kill or be killed. You must understand what I'm talking about too, right? The true meaning of ""survival of the fittest"" isn't as simple as all that.";;;;;;;;
770;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Subaru Natsuki;I guess, as long as I have life, all I can do is fight with all my might.;;;;;;;;

783;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Rem (re:zero);I love it when you stroke my hair. I feel as if we can understand each other through the contact between your hand and my hair. I love your voice. Just hearing you say one word makes my heart feel warmer. I love your eyes. Normally, they look stern,  but when you're being kind to someone,  I love the way they soften. I love your fingers. For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. But when they clutch me, I know they are the strong, slender fingers of a man. I love the way you walk. When we walk together, I love the way you occasionally turn, to make sure I keep up. I love the way you look when you sleep. You look unguarded, like an infant, and your eyelashes are on the long side. When I touch your cheek, you calm down... And when I playfully touch your lips, you don't even notice... And it makes my heart ache terribly. I love you. ;;;;;;;;
784;(Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu);Subaru Natsuki;It was rough. It was so painful. I was so scared. I was so sad. It hurt so much, I thought I'd die. I tried so hard... I tired so hard! I was so desperate, so desperate to make everything right! It's the truth. I've honestly never tried so hard at anything in my life! Because I loved this place... Because it was so important to me! I was so desperate to get back. I was scared... I was so scared! I didn't want those eyes looking at me like that again... And I hated myself so much for feeling that way!;;;;;;;;

786;(Alderamin on the Sky);Ikta Solork;People started growing crops because going hunting without knowing if you'd catch anything was a pain. People dug wells because going all the way to the river was a pain. Laziness is the mother of human progress.;;;;;;;;
787;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Kou Ichinomiya;I thought that when I grew up, I could reach more and more. The delicious looking fruit beckoning from the highest branch.The beautiful shell hidden in the sand. If I could only stretch out my hand a little more…. But…. As everyone passes through the junctures of their life, they no longer stretch their hand to the sky, or crouch to the earth. Embarrassed, they ignore what they’d desired for so long. Will you reach out and grab me, grown up as I am?;;;;;;;;
788;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Kou Ichinomiya;If I were to compare a human’s heart with the ocean, the water would be stagnant. If I were to name the ripples on the water surface….Would it be happiness? Or anger? No. For this ocean, such a description is too shallow. If I want to know what lies upon the deep ocean floors… I would have to open my eyes in the stagnant water. Then swim downwards while enduring the icy deep kicking through the cold and heavy ocean waters. If I truly want to know the human known as myself….even if.. there is nothing there.;;;;;;;;

817;(Suicide Island);Sei;I... the society I was in- says that if you don't have anything you want to do, then you're no good. That if you don't have dreams, you're no good. If you don't win, you're no good. If you can't get a nice life... if you can't accumulate a lot... then you aren't happy, they said. And yet... and yet, mom... I...

831;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Korosensei;"As you go through life, the might current of society is bound to get in your way and there will certainly be times that things don't go as you'd hoped. When this happens, don't look to society for a cause. Do not renounce society. Frankly, you'd be wasting your time. Instead just say, ""That's life!"" and muddle your way through with frustration. Once you're past it, consider: If society's swift current is tossing you around, how should you be swimming there in it's midst. You should have learned how, here in the E class, in this assassination classroom. You don't always have to stand and face it head-on. You can run and you can hide. If it's not against the rules, you can try a sneak attack. You can use unconventional weapons. Stay determined - not impatient nor discouraged - and with repeated trial and error, you're bound to reach a splendid outcome eventually.";;;;;;;;

849;(One Punch Man);Garou;If you weren't here, I would have become the world's absolute evil. Unbiased terror scattered throughout the world that can establish real peace. Don't think that all children are waiting for heroes. There are even kids around the world waiting for a great monster to take the stage. Can you save them? Can you follow the ugly kid being picked on in the park? I can. I can save the whole world with terror! While humanity is fearing Garou the Monster, everyone's hearts will unite to survive. Is there any peace other than this? Can you create peace? Can you, unbiased, save the world with that flimsy cape? Do you have the means to stop the unseen tragedies? You're strong... but so what? You may defeat me, but can you handle it? The responsibility. Well? If you're going to defeat me then answer the question! What will you accomplish? Why will you kill me now? Do you have a sense of duty like mine? Why are YOU a hero!?;;;;;;;;
850;(Assassination Classroom 2nd Season);Nagisa Shiota;If that treetop is school, and the ground is this place here... we all found our strength down on the ground. While looking up... and getting looked down on... we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing. That's why we can go our own way now. Still... Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan. That's my secret lesson, from me to you.;;;;;;;;

In a world with no room for survival, evil will disappear. And so will bullying, and discrimination, even war! What this world needs is not biased Justice but unbiased, absolute Evil! I'm fighting for world peace. No justice will be able to overthrow me. I will be stronger than anyone! I will be an absolute MONSTER!;;;;;;;;

Didn't I already know? This world is unfair. Justice and evil are decided by others. That's how the world is. To oppose the unfair power known as justice, I have to obtain the unfair power known as evil. To defeat the unfair beings known as heroes I have to become an unfair being myself!;;;;;;;;

884;(Boku dake ga Inai Machi);Satoru Fujinuma;"""Believing in someone."" That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn't need to say, ""I believe you."" It's like saying, ""I believe in air."" I don't mean to say that ""believing in something"" is like a lie. ""Believing"" is really a term of hope of wanting to believe. ";;;;;;;;

It moves forward endlessly, as surely as bodies buried in the ground will one day become white bones. Listen, it's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of the future - you gain nothing, and nothing begins. You spend your life as though already dead. Whether you wish it to or not - time never stops.

If you ruined someone's silver tableware, you must repay with gold tableware. The president of a polluting manufacturing plant must live beside the plant's chimney. That's what taking responsibility means. However the people in so-called high positions never see the consequences. When mistakes are made, they will casually bow their heads and apologize. They think that's enough. Are you one of them too?;;;;;;;;

902;(Tari Tari);Wakana Sakai;But for me, just having fun wasn't enough. The support of my friends was equally important. They encouraged me through my struggles. They're all so different from me, but they're honest and determined. We fought, but we also worked together. I know my mother had a friend like that too. Someone to have fun with.

After all, you're already up there. The place where I've always longed to be. If anything, isn't this world at fault? There's plenty of proof this world was created unfairly. The Crime rate's higher than ever. Wealth is the determining factor in life, and so when the most prestigious universities held an experiment, ""Does appearance affect the outcome in a trail?"" When comparing the results of the beautiful and the plain, the beautiful ones were declared innocent more often. Looks decide your worth. LOOKS, SEX, AGE, ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, JOB, once you realize that there will always be a 'High' and 'Low"", the goal is clear. Higher... and Higher!

938;(Katanagatari);Togame;By abandoning offense, even without winning, the result will be effectively victory.;;;;;;;;
939;(Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri);Itami Youji;If you can't see something through the end, then don't do anything.;;;;;;;;
940;(Gakkou Gurashi!);Yuki Takeya;If you bottle up your sadness too much, you'll forget what's really important.;;;;;;;;
941;(Ore Monogatari!!);Takeo Gouda;Suna, maybe people all have a hot, molten core inside their hearts, but they just live their lives, never showing it to the world, as if nothing is really going on.;;;;;;;;
942;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Kyouya Sata;"You idiot. You'd gotten yourself up in a tizzy about romance, right? ""Love"" you experience in that state is just self-delusion. There's no point in getting depressed over love like that.";;;;;;;;
943;(Puella Magi Madoka Magica);Kyubee;On this planet you call females who have yet to become adults, girls. It makes sense then that since you'll eventually become withes, you should be called Magical Girls.;;;;;;;;
944;(Mobile Suit Gundam UC);Cardeas Vist;If you trust in the possibilities within and try with all your might, the path will show itself to you!;;;;;;;;
945;(Selector Spread Wixoss);Urisu;All things shine at their most brilliant when they're being broken.;;;;;;;;
946;(Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun);Umetarō Nozaki;"You can't trust people who call themselves your friends after you've just met them. This is a trap. I know it. A friend who gets close to the protagonist like this is actually the boss, bullying them from the shadows, cornering them into utter despair. And then comes this line... ""The truth is I've hated you from the moment I met you!""";;;;;;;;
947;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;Everyone's the same, no exceptions.  All of them, equal before god.;;;;;;;;
948;(Kara no Kyoukai);Aozaki Touko;The human psyche goes out of whack so easily with minor elements, such as wall colors and staircase placement. Those who use them every day would be affected more dramatically.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
950;(Uchuu Kyoudai);Mutta Namba;It only took a moment for everything to click. In that instant, I understood. A leader is somebody who can bring a sense of calm and excitement at the same time.;;;;;;;;
951;(Kyoukai No Kanata);Hiroomi Nase;If you keep trying to reason with yourself instead of listening to your feelings, you'll never be able to feel true happiness.;;;;;;;;
952;(Aldnoah.Zero);Koichiro Marito;Sins you've committed cling to your soul and then continue to haunt you forever.The sins that have gone unpunished don't get forgiven until you die.;;;;;;;;
953;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;Whatever you lose, you'll find it again, but what you throw away you'll never get it back.;;;;;;;;
954;(One Piece);Gol D. Roger;Destiny. Fate. Dreams. These unstoppable ideas are held deep in the heart of man. As long as there people who seek freedom in this life, These things shall not vanish from the Earth.;;;;;;;;
955;(MAGI: The Labyrinth Of Magic);Alibaba Saluja;If nobody cares to accept you and wants you in this world, accept yourself and you will see that you don't need them and their selfish ideas.;;;;;;;;
956;(Naruto Shippūden);Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki;The past does not exist to remind us that the future cannot be changed. It exists to remind us what the future can be.;;;;;;;;
957;(Yowamushi Pedal Grande Road);Makishima Yuusuke;Your emotions have nothing to do with winning or losing,  but they're motivating us more than you might expect.;;;;;;;;
958;(Torikago no Tsugai);Gin Kurobe;"Life is all about ""selection"". There's no such thing as a life of being pushed around by circumstances or a life of doing as one is told.  It is you who selected to be ""swept along"" ";;;;;;;;
959;(Katanagatari);Rinne Higaki;Looking at your own memories is recognizing the parts of you that you don't want to face.;;;;;;;;
960;(Makai Ouji : Devils And Realist);William Twining;As long as humans are not virtuous beings, desire will always win over the fear of punishment. What’s necessary is not punishment, but to deal with that desire.;;;;;;;;
961;(Ore Monogatari!!);Takeo Gouda;The important things in life, like feelings, hearts, and souls, are all things you can never see. The more you try to reassure yourself that they exist, the more you feel they don't exist at all. But right now, I know for sure that they do exist. They're so close, you can almost touch them.;;;;;;;;
962;(Hamatora: The Animation);Murasaki;Human emotions are just black or white sometimes there and consistent and can even be contradictory, but that's all right.;;;;;;;;
963;(Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai);Sougetsu Ootori;The smell of blood, gunpowder and iron. This is what humanity's all about. Well then, the man in charge must always lead from the front. And yet be the last one to die.;;;;;;;;
964;(Aoharu x Kikanjuu);Matsuoka Masamune;They are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. How many times have I watched people leave up until now? I may have been able to reach them if I'd reached out, but I was afraid of being pushed away, so I simply watched them disappear into the distance.;;;;;;;;
965;(Psycho-Pass);Nobuchika Ginoza;No matter how severe the situation is, if you continue to stay there, you'll accept everything as a everyday life.;;;;;;;;
966;(The Story of Saiunkoku);Ensei Rou;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Even though each step is small, you never know if you'll end up achieving your major goal.;;;;;;;;
967;(Terraformars);Adolf Reinhardt;Even if I found happiness, my weakness can't be discarded. But, even so, I'm sure that we took the right path to move forward.;;;;;;;;
968;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;These girls are pixels. Data. I know that. So how would you describe the girl you like? Protein? Calcium? A pointless argument. What’s important is that there’s love. Isn’t that what you people always say?;;;;;;;;
969;(Special A);Hikari Hanazono;The end result is important. But what's truly important... is the journey to get there.;;;;;;;;
970;(Bleach);Riruka Dokugamine;Survival of the fittest' is just a pretty lie that they tell you. A lie to make weak people believe that if they try their best, they can come out on top. Truth is, it isn't the weak that get eaten. It's not about strength, it's about numbers. The ones who stand at the top of the food chain are the brainless dolts. The loudmouths. Because there are so, so many of them. You know it's true. Everybody does. You all just turn a blind eye and pretend not to notice.;;;;;;;;
971;(Mondaji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?);Izayoi Sakamaki;Silence implies consent.;;;;;;;;
972;(Psychic Detective Yakumo);Yakumo Saitō;Souls of the dead are like a bunch of leftover feelings from those who've died.;;;;;;;;
973;(Kill la Kill);Aikurō Mikisugi;One who relies overly on a single skill will be brought low by that very same skill.;;;;;;;;
974;(Hajime no Ippo);Takamura Mamoru;No matter how much talent you have, if you aren't the best, you're nothing because there can only be one king. If you're in his shadow, then history won't see you.;;;;;;;;
975;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Magata Shiki;"It is right for me, but not for you. Either way, the concept of ""right"" means no more than that.";;;;;;;;
976;(No Game No Life);Sora;"Whats the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers? Normaly it would be 1/50. But what if its a brand new deck? The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it's the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that's right! I didn't say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn't ask. Being in the ""no"" gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor. ";;;;;;;;
977;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I am the God placed here to save the weak and create a perfect world.;;;;;;;;
978;(Haikyuu!!);Tobio Kageyama;The last ones standing are the victors. Only the strongest. If you want to be the last one standing become strong.;;;;;;;;
979;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;A victor must speak not of the current state of the world, but of how it should rightfully be.;;;;;;;;
980;(Black Butler II);Alois Trancy;Once drowned in the depths of darkness, you lose sight of light. When that light has dispersed there is no return. My light has died out long ago and so there's nothing back for me to go back, or look forward to I shall continue to indulge myself in this darkness until it completely consumes me, then I will be nothing but an empty course left on this cold & cruel world to rot.;;;;;;;;
981;(Haikyuu!! Second Season);Ikkei Ukai;There's no match you can't win, and there's no match that you'll win for sure.;;;;;;;;
982;(Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri);Kurokawa Mari;People can't live for the future without accepting reality.;;;;;;;;
983;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;I'll sooner die than become burden.;;;;;;;;
984;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Magata Shiki;"Every individual human affects the surrounding environment. But humans do not exist for the things and people around them. Often, they mistakenly think that they wish to exist for the sake of others, or to help everyone. They can not accept that they don't know why they exist, yes? They always want an answer. That is the nature of the animals called ""humans"".";;;;;;;;
985;(Subete ga F ni Naru);Magata Shiki;No one fears death. They fear the life that leads up to death. If one could die without suffering, no one would fear death, right? Being alive is, itself, an exception. The natural state of things is death. And life is, itself, a kind of sickness. When the illness is cured, your life vanishes.;;;;;;;;
986;(Kuroko No Basket);Shun Izuki;Does math bring out your wrath?;;;;;;;;
987;(Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans);Mikazuki Augus;I've never been victimized for anything. I am just doing what I can for me and my comrades. And right now, you're in my way.;;;;;;;;
988;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Do you know the phrase “enough specks of dust creates a mountain”? Or maybe “three heads are better than one.” In other words, when people gathered together, they become even stronger and more secure. However, we were a group of failures who had gathered to do pointless things.;;;;;;;;
989;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;If you realize you made a mistake with the way you've been living your life, you just have to take the next moment and start over.;;;;;;;;
990;(Sword Art Online II);Konno Yuuki;God would never put us through all this suffering if he didn't think we could bear it.;;;;;;;;
991;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;If you let yourself get depressed, you'd be making light of the people who trust and follow you.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
993;(Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun);Mikoto Mikoshiba;There's nothing more satisfying than conquering all types of girls.;;;;;;;;
994;(Kiniro no Corda: Blue♪Sky);Len Tsukimori;The sounds you find pretty, and the sounds the other members find pretty... Are they really the same?;;;;;;;;
995;(Guilty Crown);Shū Ouma;No, but I can learn. I'll bathe in blood. If that's what it takes to protect my friends, I'll take it. All the hatred, the disease. I'll take it as my own and end it. ;;;;;;;;
996;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Tatsuya Shiba;How many people you killed, or how many you let live, it doesn't matter to me. You people incurred my wrath... That's reason enough, for you to meet your demise. ;;;;;;;;
997;(Noragami);Yato;To put things simply, if your past makes your present... Then your present can and will make your future. When you think about it that way... You absolutely have the potential to be anything you want to be, don't you agree?;;;;;;;;
998;(Chihayafuru);Taichi Mashima;Love is when it isn't fun to be with that person. It's when nothing goes the way you want. When you're not having fun... and yet you still want to be with that person.;;;;;;;;
999;(Toriko);Coco;Whether it's disappointing or not depends on the person. Things like uneasiness or indecision are in everyone's lives. What's important is to appreciate and grow from every kind of result. If you can grow from them, you can understand that all events are for the purpose of growing and you can appreciate them.;;;;;;;;
1000;(Haikyuu!!);Daichi Sawamura;We're basically developing at this point, and we don't know the limits of our potential. Even if we felt those limits we would still keep aiming higher.;;;;;;;;
1001;(Haikyuu!!);Tobio Kageyama;Y-you actually used your head??? You're going to get a fever!;;;;;;;;
1002;(Haikyuu!!);Shōyō Hinata;But now we can fight. Even if they read us or catch up to us...;;;;;;;;
"We can fight!""";;;;;;;;;;;
1003;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;I'm bothered by the very fact that people exist, but you're an exception.;;;;;;;;
1004;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;If I can, I'd like to bring back what she has lost, what she threw away.;;;;;;;;
1005;(Inazuma Eleven);Gouenji Shuuya;Unnecessary thoughts will only interfere with your plays.;;;;;;;;
1006;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;I'm not highly aware. I'm highly self-aware.;;;;;;;;
1007;(Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works);Emiya Kiritsugu;Unfortunately... being a hero is a limited-time thing. When you grow up, it becomes harder to call yourself one. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize that.;;;;;;;;
1008;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;I'll keep my promise, I'll save the world. ;;;;;;;;
1009;(One Punch Man);Saitama;Human beings are strong because we have the ability to change ourselves.;;;;;;;;
1010;(Kekkai Sensen);William Macbeth;Death is a privilege of the living. A destiny without reason, continually roving on, evermore. How fleeting a thing it is. One cannot live and forget about death. The despair that is me, forgotten by death, can at least embrace my yearning at twilight, and sleep.;;;;;;;;
1011;(Gakusen Toshi Asterisk);Amagiri Ayato;I wouldn't call myself a saint, but I think I do alright. My mind's about as sharp as the average person. When it comes to an iron will or noble spirit, well... I might have to ask you to turn a blind eye there...;;;;;;;;
1012;(NANA);Nana Osaki;I always thought that life was about standing your ground, no matter how strong the current was. But going with the flow isn’t so bad after all. As long as it takes you forward.;;;;;;;;
1013;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;"People should be doubted. Many people misunderstand this concept. Doubting people is just a part of getting to know them. What many people call ""trust"" is really just giving up on trying to understand others, and that very act is far worse than doubting. It is actually ""apathy"".";;;;;;;;
1014;(Ghost Hunt);Mai Taniyama;There are things that we don't want to happen, but have to accept. Things that we don't want to know, but have to learn. And people that we can't live without, but have to let go.;;;;;;;;
1015;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Shuntarou Chishiya;"Do you know the origin of the word ""utopia""? The English philosopher, Thomas More, created this word with intense irony in mind. In Greek, it means ""A place that does not exist"".";;;;;;;;
1016;(Ghost Hunt);Mai Taniyama;"Having the love of your life break up with you and say ""we can still be friends"", is like your dog dying and your mom saying ""you can still keep it"".";;;;;;;;
1017;(The Heroic Legend of Arslan);Farangis;The throne itself does not half a will of its own. Depending upon who sits in it, it can be the seat of justice or it can be the seat of inhuman cruelty. As long as it is a man and not a god, doing the governing, he can never be perfect. But should he neglect to make efforts to reach for perfection, a king will surely tumble down the slippery slope towards evil with no one around to stop him.;;;;;;;;
1018;(Akagami no Shirayukihime);Zen Wistalia;I don't think it's all that bad to be surrounded by people who don't care much about authority or social status. It's good to know that there are various various ways of thinking.;;;;;;;;
1019;(Tsumi to Batsu: A Falsified Romance);Kai Sudo;Does this world feel like hell to you? Of course it does, because it is. So take it all in, don't even blink, Miroku. There's no place like hell! We made it so. With our lust, and greed. It always comes down to this. Life is desire. It's what we do. When desire meets desire, the stronger survives. The predator will eat the prey. It's dirty, and cruel. But just look around you, there is so much beauty in this truth. And yet you still look away. And you waste all your time alone in your head. Don't deny your desires. Hell is the real paradise. And we, my friend, are in paradise! Don't look away, Miroku!;;;;;;;;
1020;(Durarara!!×2 Ten);Izaya Orihara;Oh, please. This world is so entertaining because it doesn't do anyone's bidding!;;;;;;;;
1021;(Durarara!!);Kyohei Kadota;If you want to run from your past, fine. But whatever you do, don't run away from your present or worse, your future.;;;;;;;;
1022;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;Maybe there’s only a dark road up ahead. But you still have to believe and keep going. Believe that the stars will light your path, even a little bit.;;;;;;;;
1023;(Kanon);Sayuri Kurata;The same melody repeats itself as the song grows richer and more beautiful. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could live seemingly constant lives while experiencing changes bit by bit?;;;;;;;;
1024;(Monochrome Factor);Shirogane;There's always something one can't explain even if one has experience with it.;;;;;;;;
1025;(Ore Monogatari!!);Takeo Gouda;Why won't human emotions, not even my own, work out the way we want?;;;;;;;;
1026;(One Punch Man);Saitama;I'll leave tomorrow's problems to tomorrow's me.;;;;;;;;
1027;(Free! Eternal Summer);Haruka Nanase;A dream? A future? Stop going on about other people's futures when you haven't even decided your own! ;;;;;;;;
1028;(Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri);Rory Mercury;Ruling over death means ruling over life. Death is the climax of life. To have the best death, you must honor life. ;;;;;;;;
1029;(Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou);Rachnera Arachnera;Pretending to get along is just hypocritical. If you don't like me, that's fine. People are free to like and hate what they want.;;;;;;;;
1030;(Denpa Kyoushi);Kagami Junichirou;Don't act because something is interesting, but act because you want to find something more interesting! In this world, there are so much interesting things. Do something that you don't want to do, you don't have even a second for it.;;;;;;;;
1031;(Aria the Animation);Alicia Florence;I'm sure that things that are truly fun can't be compared. Back then, now, and from now on, in the time you spend with others, lots of small fun things are born and disappear. If you are able to capture each of them, you'll never run out of fun things. Forever and ever. And here's one point of advice. Thinking that now is fun is what makes it the most fun.;;;;;;;;
1032;(One Punch Man);Saitama;I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.;;;;;;;;
1033;(Toriko);Toriko;"In this world, there's no such thing as ""failure"" in the first place. The one who knows the ""ways to win"" more than anyone is also the one who's experienced the most ""mistakes"". In other words... You could say ""failure"" is equal to ""success""... Couldn't you?";;;;;;;;
1034;(Kekkai Sensen);William Macbeth;Me? A liar? That's almost hurtful. I just don't feel like telling the whole truth.;;;;;;;;
1035;(Kekkai Sensen);Mary Macbeth;Everyone dies eventually, whether they have power or not. That's why you need to think about what you'll accomplish while you're alive.;;;;;;;;
1036;(Durarara!!×2 Shou);Izaya Orihara;Let’s say I posed this question to you: “Can all human souls be bought with money or not?” Now remember, the keyword here is “all”. The answer is “There are times when you can buy them, and other times, not,” right? The human being… sometimes he’ll uphold his pride and conscience even if he’s offered ten billion yen, and other times he’ll murder someone over one yen.;;;;;;;;
1037;(Himouto! Umaru-chan);Umaru Doma;You never appreciate the irreplaceable things in life until they're gone. Like summer vacation... or brothers.;;;;;;;;
1038;(Assassination Classroom);Karma Akabane;People with talent often have the wrong impression that things will go as they think.;;;;;;;;
1039;(Aoharu x Kikanjuu);Tachibana Hotaru;I never thought about winning making me cool, or losing making me uncool. But you're right. If anything... Giving up before you even try is kind of uncool. That's why I want to be someone who'll fight as many times as it takes, and never give up. That's got to be way more cooler.;;;;;;;;
1040;(Aoharu x Kikanjuu);Tachibana Hotaru;I may not be able to beat you, even if we play a hundred more games. But if I have a chance of beating you the 101st time, I'll challenge you again and again.;;;;;;;;
1041;(Utawarerumono);Urutori;It's alright to feel sad. When you're sad, you should experience that sorrow fully. It's not too late to move on after that.;;;;;;;;
1042;(Perfect Blue);Eri Ochiai;How do you know that the person you were one second ago, is the same person that you are right now?;;;;;;;;
1043;(Gankutsuou);Peppo;If people could become friends simply by sharing bread and salt, life would be simpler.;;;;;;;;
1044;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Furudo Erika;...Without love, it cannot be seen? ...Hah. That's backwards... Because of love, you end up seeing things that don't even exist.;;;;;;;;
1045;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Gaap;Don't deny your dreams, ok? There is no point at all in taking a first step, if your eyes are closed and you don't gaze at the future.;;;;;;;;
1046;(Toradora!);Minori Kushieda;Crying is a nosebleed of the heart.;;;;;;;;
1047;(Fairy Tail);Gajeel Redfox;It's not a sin to fall in love. You can't even arrest someone over that.;;;;;;;;
1048;(Hunter X Hunter);Killua Zoldyck;If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, wouldn't I be betraying him?;;;;;;;;
1049;(Ao no Exorcist);Rin Okumura;Don't just mindlessly judge people as you please.;;;;;;;;
1050;(Hellsing Ultimate);Montana Max;There is one thing that makes a human a human... and that is their will.;;;;;;;;
1051;(Hamatora: The Animation);Moral;If providing people with what they desire is a sin, then all mothers are sinners, and the world is bereft of love.;;;;;;;;
1052;(Hamatora: The Animation);Murasaki;Sometimes, I just think... this world has surpassed its capacity. It's overflowing. Our day-to-day lives are replete with both happiness and misfortune. Yet, because we cannot see the excess from the inside, we still feel unfulfilled. Given that we are capable of acknowledging neither excess nor deprivation, we might as well not exist. In other words... you can't withdraw coins from an ATM. That's common sense.;;;;;;;;
1053;(Toradora!);Minori Kushieda;Even when the sky's so dark you can't see a thing, there are still stars shining out there. So if she can learn to shine brighter, we'll be able to see her.;;;;;;;;
1054;(Hamatora: The Animation);Moral;The weak can never break out of their own mold. They cry piteously within their cells, while they try to kick down anyone who strives to break free. ;;;;;;;;
1055;(Hamatora: The Animation);Murasaki;You chose to go with the flow and you think that doesn't make you guilty?;;;;;;;;
1056;(Kanon);Aizawa Yuuichi;Every dream has an end...No matter how nice the dream might be, or how scary it is. Under your warm blanket, the dream comes to an abrupt end, when mother shakes you awake. Forever and ever, the morning scene remains the same. But now I... I wonder... when the dreams began to never end.;;;;;;;;
1057;(Kanon);Shiori Misaka;It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen.;;;;;;;;
1058;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;If you're going to selfishly admire someone only to be disillusioned later, then maybe you shouldn't try to get to know them better at all. ;;;;;;;;
1059;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;When you love someone, I think it's only natural to worry about what they love.;;;;;;;;
1060;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;You may be unfortunate, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer. You may not be blessed, but that doesn't mean you have to throw a fit over it. Even if bad things happen to you, just be strong!;;;;;;;;
1061;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.;;;;;;;;
1062;(Last Game);Mikoto Kujou;After all the hiding your true self, even if you eventually become popular, won't you just feel exhausted by it in the end?;;;;;;;;
1063;(Toradora!);Minori Kushieda;I don't want to get so caught up in searching for what I can't see, that I lose sight of what I can.;;;;;;;;
1064;(Last Game);Mikoto Kujou;I don't care if you're the son of the president or what. That just shows the success of your father. It doesn't mean you are excellent too.;;;;;;;;
1065;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru.);Hachiman Hikigaya;There was no meaning to things that were only superficial. That was a single belief that both me and her once shared. ;;;;;;;;
1066;(Inazuma Eleven);Mark Kluger;Certain individuals can change the entire outlook of the team with their overwhelming abilities.;;;;;;;;
1067;(Persona 3);Pharos;Time is something no one can escape. It delivers us all to the same end.;;;;;;;;
1068;(Toradora!);Minori Kushieda;My happiness can only be... can only be made with my own hands! My happiness doesn't depend on anyone but me!;;;;;;;;
1069;(Akagami no Shirayukihime);Zen Wistalia;If people scrutinize you, just ignore them and do whatever you want to do.;;;;;;;;
1070;(One Piece);Brook;"""Loneliness"" is no longer part of my vocabulary.";;;;;;;;
1071;(One Piece);Brook;Death is never an apology.;;;;;;;;
1072;(Toradora!);Minori Kushieda;I believe in ghosts, even though I've never seen one before and get this. I don't believe in anyone of the people that have said they seen one before. It's kind of like how I think about the concept of love. Like I believe one day I'll fall in love, get married and live happily ever after, even though I've never actually fallen in love with anyone yet. You see what I'm saying? For some people falling in love is like second nature, but I can't even relate to that. So if I've never fallen in love before is it real? And that makes me wonder if ghost are real. I haven't seen one yet so maybe they're not.;;;;;;;;
1073;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;Those who can't do what they have to when the time comes for action will find their presence fading in our classroom. An assassin who neglects to sharpen his blade is no assassin at all. He's just a boastful brat swinging around a rusty sword.;;;;;;;;
1074;(Overlord);Ainz Ooal Gown;It's fine. Everyone makes mistakes. You just need to make an effort not to make the same mistake again.;;;;;;;;
1075;(Overlord);Dyne Woodwonder;The words you've said cannot be taken back. So you must take action to paint over what you have already said.;;;;;;;;
1076;(Classroom Crisis);Classroom Crisis;The most certain way to succeed is to try one more time. Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.;;;;;;;;
1077;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;There are only two times when a man can cry in public: when he loses his wallet and when his mother dies. And even if you cry in private, there's a severe restriction. Shed tears for others. The only thing you should be shedding for yourself is sweat. Remember that.;;;;;;;;
1078;(Code Geass: Akito the Exiled);Lelouch Lamperouge;The ideal tool for controlling people is fear. And nothing overwhelms people more than an unseen fear.;;;;;;;;
1079;(Uchuu Kyoudai);Mutta Namba;There are people who don't know you, who are saying a lot of awful things. But just saying stuff is easy, and anyone can do it. However...There's no one out there who could take your place.;;;;;;;;
1080;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;The difference between the novice and the master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried.;;;;;;;;
1081;(Polar Bear's Café);Grizzly-san;You're not supposed to find yourself, you're supposed to choose yourself!;;;;;;;;
1082;(One Piece);One Piece;If you hurt somebody or if someone hurts you, - the same red blood will be shed.;;;;;;;;
1083;(One Piece);Trafalgar Law;There are things you can't see unless you change your standing.;;;;;;;;
1084;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;If the drive behind one's actions is the thought for another, then it is never meaningless.;;;;;;;;
1085;(NANA);Shinichi Okazaki;It's dangerous here. If you stare at the stars long enough, you start thinking you could grab one, and you get this feeling like all your dreams will come true.;;;;;;;;
1086;(Kekkai Sensen);Klaus von Reinherz;You're not a coward. I know that because you haven't given up yet. You're standing here. As long as you face the light and take even one step, the human soul can never truly be defeated.;;;;;;;;
1087;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;When you fight hard and fail, the regret is easier to get past than the regret of not trying.;;;;;;;;
1088;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;If they find out what you did there, a lot of people will say a lot of things to you. Some will say you did the right thing. And some will say you did the wrong thing. But that's not what matters. No matter what anyone says, you don't have to worry. Because you didn't do the right thing, and you didn't do the wrong thing. It was all part of being young.;;;;;;;;
1089;(One Piece);One Piece;They are more like “people who don’t follow rules…” There are different kinds of people in different worlds! … Between you two and them, what is the difference? It isn’t unusual… to put it to an extreme… A hero during a war would be just another murderer in peaceful times. ;;;;;;;;
1090;(Vandread);Meia Gisborn;Regardless of what happens our lives are finite. We all know that we will grow old and that someday our lives will end. That's why we try so hard to live each day to the fullest. That's why we keep stumbling on by trial and error. But it isn't just for ourselves, it's so we can leave some signposts for the people following in our foot steps. To cowards who cling to where they are and who have given up on trying to move forward there is no way to see how bright the future is even though it's just around the corner!;;;;;;;;
1091;(Vandread);Hibiki Tokai;You can worry about things all you want, but it doesn't mean you'll always get an answer. What's important to remember, is that when it's all said and done and you got through it all somehow, are you the person you wanted to be?;;;;;;;;
1092;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru.);Hachiman Hikigaya;Everyone is a slave to their past. No matter how much you wish to move forward, the events of last year will bear down on you like the light of the stars as soon as you glance up. Unable to laugh or to banish your past, you carry it ceaselessly in a corner of your heart, waiting for it to resurrect at an inopportune moment.;;;;;;;;
1093;(Yowamushi Pedal);Shōkichi Naruko;To stop or to keep going? The one who decides is yourself.;;;;;;;;

1096;(Infinite Ryvius);Kouji Aiba;There's a limit to the strength of people who are isolated. If we do the best we can we should be fine. We don't grab a hold of the entire future. Let's just think about grabbing tomorrow. I think that's plenty for us, don't you?;;;;;;;;

1099;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;We have no need for the past. All we need are the present and the future.;;;;;;;;
1100;(Infinite Ryvius);Kouji Aiba;I think that sometimes things just won't go the way we want them to. And every day there's bound to be something that makes us mad when there's nothing we can do to change the state of affairs. But that's not entirely true, either. We have to give these kinds of things some real thought as well. If we're sitting back and waiting for the future to arrive - we don't have anything invested in tomorrow. I don't want a tomorrow like that.;;;;;;;;
1101;(Shokugeki no Sōma);Kojirō Shinomiya;If you want to grow just look above you, there are plenty of people perfect to serve as fodder for your growth.;;;;;;;;
1102;(One Piece);Crocodile;Wake up princess, I'm tired of your useless ideals. It's gotten pathetic. What good are your happy ideals if you can't do anything to make them a reality? They're nothing but dreams, and your dreams don't stand a chance.;;;;;;;;
1103;(Bleach);Ganju Shiba;I think you and I have different concepts of beauty. I was taught that it's beautiful to survive, unsightly or not.;;;;;;;;

1108;(Pandora Hearts);Ada Vessalius;What is really wicked... is judging people without even trying to get to know them!;;;;;;;;
1109;(Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka?);Eucliwood Hellscythe;Today's my birthday. During times like these I always think whether or not it was a good thing that I was born.;;;;;;;;
1110;(One Piece);Jimbei;It is a sad truth that greater the authority a person possesses, the more he tends to fear change. ;;;;;;;;
1111;(Durarara!!);Simon Brezhnev;You're happy enough, so don't take away the happiness of others. You should share it.;;;;;;;;
1112;(Mobile Suit Gundam UC);Marida Cruz;Kindness alone can't save people. It can't erase sin or wash away the impurities.;;;;;;;;
1113;(ef - a tale of memories);Himura Yuu;This world revolves around two views on the same thing. In addition, it's about laughable miseries. ;;;;;;;;
1114;(Uchouten Kazoku);Yasaburou Shimogamo;There are all sorts of goodbyes. There are sad goodbyes, and sometimes goodbyes you're thankful for, that take a load off your mind. It often happens that someone you say goodbye to unexpectedly returns, all self-conscious. Then there are times when, anticipating that, you put on the front of a short goodbye, only to have them not return so soon. And then there are goodbyes that last forever, true goodbyes that only happen once in your life.;;;;;;;;
1115;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;Your impression of people is renewed every day. As you spend time with them and grow with them, you come to understand more.;;;;;;;;
1116;(Grisaia no Rakuen);Yumiko Sakaki;They say that in hard times, you'll never in your life forget the person who gave you a cup of water.;;;;;;;;
1117;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;There are people who ruin the atmosphere just by existing, you know.;;;;;;;;
1118;(Grisaia no Rakuen);Yuuji Kazami;Skilled only at making excuses that justify nothing, he is someone whose life has no value. The same goes for me. I have the right to stop you because I'm just like you.;;;;;;;;
1119;(The World God Only Knows);Nora Floriann Leoria;When you compare love and hate in this world... There is a lot more hate than love, and it's much stronger. So, if we consider every one of them as hate, we'll be right most of the time. I don't have time to pick out the truth anyway.;;;;;;;;
1120;(Magical Warfare);Takeshi Nanase;There're too many people who worry about the things I don't worry about.;;;;;;;;
1121;(Grisaia no Rakuen);Yuuji Kazami;To ensure that all I've done won't end up a lie. I don't want to talk big game to people, then run away when it matters the most. This is a wall I must overcome on my own. If there's anything I want to change, I have to change myself. If I must become evil to defeat evil, I will become the devil himself. That's all to it.;;;;;;;;
1122;(Kuroko No Basket);Hyuuga Junpei;Don't go believing everyone with glasses is smart!;;;;;;;;
1123;(Kuroko No Basket);Taiga Kagami;If we understood how other people felt, then nobody would ever start wars!;;;;;;;;
1124;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;As they say about the vulgar masses, the more people flock to a group, the more foolish they become. No matter how prominent an individual is, no, it’s because he is prominent that he would be blotted out by the sheer force of numbers when thrown into that lump of people. Individual will, qualifications, and personality, let alone emotions aren’t considered at all.;;;;;;;;
We see only what we want to see; listen only to what we want to listen to; but for the things we want to say; we aren’t able to. This is the society that we’re living in right now.;;;;;;;;

1127;(Hibike! Euphonium);Kumiko Oumae;People aren't complicated. We work hard when we know that we'll get something in return, and we try to work even harder if that something is our own improvement.;;;;;;;;
1128;(One Piece);Brook;What do you know of death?!! Have you ever died?!! You think death will preserve your cause forever?!! Ridiculous!! Death leaves nothing behind!! Once a person passes on, nothing remains but dead bones!! If there is one thing I can’t stand, it is a person with no respect for life!! ;;;;;;;;

I can end my journey surrounded by so many people; in the arms of the person I love.;;;;;;;;;;
I... I did my best to live;" I lived here.""";;;;;;;;;;
1140;(Subarashii Sekai);Subarashii Sekai;This world that we live in is gentle yet sad, fun yet sorrowful, strong yet ephemeral... ...but as long as you're alive, something good is bound to happen. I'm sure of it.;;;;;;;;
1141;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;You yourself have to change first, or nothing will change for you!;;;;;;;;
1142;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Sake sure is nice. You can forget your troubles if only for a moment. You'll have to remember them tomorrow though, and they'll be even more painful than they were the night before. You can't run away from things like this. Especially from things you really want to forget.;;;;;;;;
1143;(Hentai Ouji To Warawanai Neko);Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi;Ash to ashes, dust to dust, trash to trash can and useless people to uselessness box.;;;;;;;;
1144;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Gaap;'Slacking off' sounds bad. However, enjoying more of your day with the time you saved by doing your job in a clever way is definitely not a bad thing. Times like that are what makes a human's life rich. If you exaggerate, it could be called laziness, surely. However, people only become mature when they are able to balance work with enjoyment. In short, if all you care about is your job, you're not fully mature.;;;;;;;;
1145;(Hunter X Hunter);Shoot McMahon;I've always gone to any lengths to avoid facing danger and risk, hiding myself within  a safe cage, where no one could hurt me. I hated myself for it.. But I couldn't change myself.. Friends and teachers encouraged me, but I never truly listened, considering it the logic of the strong. Yet somehow... A boy with less than half my strength managed to break my cage! ;;;;;;;;
1146;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Yui Yuigahama;Why is it that what I want, and what's expected of me are so similar, yet so different?;;;;;;;;
1147;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;Honestly, there isn't much meaning to the splendid names given to you by your parents. What does have meaning, is what the person behind that name does during their actual lifetime. The name doesn't make the person. The name simply remains gently within the footprint left on the path a person walks.;;;;;;;;
1148;(One Piece);Smoker;Don't ever think there's any perfect society made by humans!! If you think that way you'll overlook the enemy!! Don't be fooled by appearances!!;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
1150;(Fate Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works);Gilgamesh;"""Hero of Justice? A world where no one is hurt?"" Don't be absurd. ""Humanity"" is the name for an animal that cannot find joy in life without sacrifice. The pretty lie that is ""equality"" is nonsense spouted by weaklings who cannot look upon the darkness. Nothing but an excuse to cover up life's ugliness.";;;;;;;;
1151;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;"""True to herself"", ""True to myself"". We all have our own personal image that's dictated by others, one that's always off the mark. We wish to remain true to ourselves, but who gets to decide who we are as people? When our image never goes hand-in-hand with reality, where can we find something genuine? Where can we find our true selves?";;;;;;;;
1152;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;People usually don't look back to see how far they've come while they're still walking. Of course, when they come to a standstill, the more progress they've made, the more betrayed they feel by their expectations.;;;;;;;;
1153;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;The past makes you wanna die out of regret and future makes you depressed out of anxiety. So by elimination, the present is likely the happiest time.;;;;;;;;
1154;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Don't worry. When people break their old selves they embark a journey to find their new selves.;;;;;;;;
1155;(Houkago no Pleiades);Minato;Hope brings me pain... if I didn't have any hope at all, I might never have known such agony.;;;;;;;;
1156;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;"There's no use in just creating ""Love"". Empty hearts filled with ""Love"" tend to be unstable.";;;;;;;;
1157;(Plastic Memories);Michiru Kinushima;It's more cruel to give someone false hope, you know.;;;;;;;;
1158;(Kekkai Sensen);William Macbeth;Everyone thinks at some point if what they are doing has any meaning or not. Will the day come when I get what's coming to me, or not? How much influence does my existence have on the world at all, or doesn't it?;;;;;;;;
1159;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Tsubasa Hanekawa;Someone saying that they are happy doesn't necessarily mean that they are happy, right?;;;;;;;;
1160;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);Tooru Kazasumi;If another me was born somewhere else, and had led a different life, how would he feel? If there was another version of myself somewhere on the other side of the ocean, what would happen if I were able to meet him? Would I be able to be his friend? Or would the differences in our upbringing be something that I couldn't overcome? Can I understand him because he is me? Or will he be impossible to understand because he's me?;;;;;;;;
1161;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Deishū Kaiki;Romance can strengthen people, but it can also make them useless.;;;;;;;;
1162;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);Kyouka Katagiri;We fail. We make mistakes. But each time we do, I think we become stronger.;;;;;;;;
1163;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);TimeKeeper;Humans continue to live in a cycle of death and destruction. Guns can't change anything. It merely creates an infinite chain of hatred and retribution.;;;;;;;;
1164;(Plastic Memories);Isla;Because nothing makes one happier than being with the one you love.;;;;;;;;
1165;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);Tooru Kazasumi;Pain, suffering, sadness... We all accept it, and that's why we can move forward!;;;;;;;;
1166;(Akatsuki no Yona);Su-won;However, even if it is reckless... I don't think someone who is making their best effort to try and break through the current situation is foolish.;;;;;;;;
1167;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Takeshi Yamamoto;When you're really in trouble, of course I'd come and help.;;;;;;;;
That's what friends are for;" right?""";;;;;;;;;;
1168;(The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan);Yuki Nagato;That, I don't want to do. You may feel that I'm currently an abnormal Nagato Yuki. That judgement is correct. But I myself cannot accept that I am abnormal... because if I do, I'll become alone. I was scared, so I tried to hide it.;;;;;;;;
1169;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;When people reach the halfway mark of a long ordeal, how do they feel? Does being only halfway there make them despair? Or do they feel relief at making it halfway there? Most people have to feel one way or the other, and both emotions create an opening in their hearts. That's why I pushed myself this far. ;;;;;;;;
1170;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hayato Hayama;When you pick the only option you have to choose from, can you really call that your own decision?;;;;;;;;
1171;(Plastic Memories);Kazuki Kuwanomi;That's human nature. We have regrets, and go on blaming ourselves forever. ;;;;;;;;
1172;(High School DxD BorN);Vali Lucifer;What you think of as peace can be painful for others.;;;;;;;;
1173;(Black Rock Shooter);Mato Kuroi;Love is a bitter sweet taste of life, which many humans many weaknesses and sometimes their strongest weapon.;;;;;;;;
1174;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Sovereignty means absolutely nothing in front of me. ;;;;;;;;
1175;(Aria the Animation);Akari Mizunashi;If one feels it is fun now, one will be able to enjoy life the most. Everything will change over time, so we must treasure the happy moments before us.;;;;;;;;
1176;(Air Gear);Kazuma Mikura;If training hard can make you number one, then how many number one do you think this world will have!?;;;;;;;;
1177;(Nisemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;"It isn't just ""others"". Not ""others"". It's my Family. I'll force my ideals on my family. And since they're family, I'll lie to them. I'll deceive them. I'll cause them trouble. I'll make them worry. I'll owe them things, things I'll never be able to repay. However, I think that's okay. If you say that being an impostor is evil, then I will shoulder the burden of that evil. If lying is a bad thing, then I'm fine being the bad person. I don't need them to like me. I'm fine with being the worst kind of person.";;;;;;;;
1178;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Tsubaki Sawabe;I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this. Sure, I know that I have no right to be feeling this way. But I still don't like it! I just don't like it. We were always together. I was always by his side. During time of joy, and grief as well. But...I realize he's far away from me now... I'm not by his side...there's somebody else there... I don't like this! Look at me! Look at me, will you? Not with those eyes... Don't look at someone else!;;;;;;;;
1179;(Ojojojo);Kawayanagi Tsurezure;That's probably true. I like talking with people. I wonder if speaking with me is boring though. Since once people talk to me, they'll never do it again. But I don't feel like starting a conversation either, since in the direction I ought to look, there are only people who I cannot talk to. That's why I look at the sky... It's strange how merely observing things can be so handy to kill time. It hurts that I get called a weirdo just for making a habit out of it and in the end it just makes me stare at the sky even more. I've probably always been like this. Thinking about it, there's nothing I can do about my passiveness. Waiting things out is just my nature. I'm sure that... things will get better someday...;;;;;;;;
1180;(Ore Monogatari!!);Takeo Gouda;People are born into this world. And people are taken from this world.;;;;;;;;

1182;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;You can’t take back the answer you already gave out. There’s no use in crying over spilt milk. The egg you broke won’t come back. All the horses and soldiers of a king will never return to his side again.;;;;;;;;
It doesn’t matter what was said. You can never wipe away a bad impression.;;;;;;;;;;;
Even though the opposite is so simple in comparison. Just one word will make someone appear hateful. Just doing one thing would make you seem hateful.;;;;;;;;;;;
"That’s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful.""";;;;;;;;;;;
1183;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Komachi Hikigaya;"Identity? What? The people who yap about identities all the time are usually the ones with no identity. Like something that changes so easily could really be an ""identity"", anyway.";;;;;;;;
1184;(Medaka Box);Misogi Kumagawa;I want to beat them. Even though I'm not cool, or strong, or just, or beautiful, or cute, or pretty, I want to beat the cool, strong, just, beautiful, cute, and pretty people. Even though I wasn't blessed with talent, even though I'm stupid and have a bad personality, have bad grades, am misguided and am a good for nothing, I want to beat the talented, smart, likeable, overachieving people. I want to beat those with friends when I can't have friends. I want to beat the people who work hard when I can't work hard. I want to beat the the victorious people when I can't win. I want to beat the happy people when I'm miserable. Even if I'm hated, even if I'm despised, even if I'm useless, I want to prove that I'm better than the main characters!;;;;;;;;
1185;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Tsubaki Sawabe;Even though I'm bitter over losing, even though I'm depressed, even though my ankle hurts, and my eyes are smeared with tears...even though I've never felt worse...I wonder why the stars are sparkling like this. The scent of the music room in his hair. I can hear his slightly ragged breathing. His shoulder, wet with tears, is so warm. I am by his side. I wish time would just stand still.;;;;;;;;
1186;(Ojojojo);Kawayanagi Tsurezure;Whatever. It's okay, isn't it? Being dishonest with your feelings is part of who you are. If that would just suddenly change overnight, you'd be a different person.;;;;;;;;
1187;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);TimeKeeper;To believe in someone can be a dangerous thing.;;;;;;;;
1188;(Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex);Tachikoma;Maybe, just maybe, it's a concept that's similar to a zero in mathematics. In other words, it's a symbol that denies the absence of meaning, the meaning that's necessitated by the delineation of one system from another. In analog, that's God. In digital, that's zero.;;;;;;;;
1189;(Karneval);Karoku Arumerita;But the truth is merely the majority of the living. It only revolves around their choices and actions and nothing more.;;;;;;;;
1190;(RWBY);Blake Belladonna;Unfortunately, the real world isn't the same as a fairy tale.;;;;;;;;
1191;(Black Cat);Train Heartnet;The past isn't something you can just throw away. It stays with us forever. It's the same for everyone. We must live on, and carry the burdens of the past with us. That's why it's important that you carry the burden of what you do now and how you've decided to live your life today.;;;;;;;;
1192;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Monokuma;Everyone's birthplace and upbringing is different. It's obviously impossible for them to understand each other.;;;;;;;;
1193;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled,  then I wouldn't wish or desire for anything after all. The things you're handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that is why I'll always keep searching.;;;;;;;;
1194;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;This is your life right? Then decide for yourself! If you want to protect everything with your hands then do so, if you want to abandon everything then do so. But, what do you yourself want to do right now? Can you really be satisfied giving someone else that you don’t really understand your most important thing?;;;;;;;;
1195;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;Now, you’ve only got two different options to choose from: Prove that everything I just said was bullshit, or admit your guilt.;;;;;;;;
1196;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;I don't mind losing to someone, but I won't be beaten by myself.;;;;;;;;
1197;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved might hurt them too. But if it's someone you don't care about, you won't notice you've hurt them. What's important is your awareness of it. It's because you care about them, that you feel like you've hurt them. Caring about someone means being resolved to the fact that you'll hurt them. The more people care for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But that's not something to be sad about, I think it's probably something to be proud of.;;;;;;;;
1198;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;Thinking you'll understand without being told anything is an illusion.;;;;;;;;
1199;(Plastic Memories);Michiru Kinushima;Losing sight of who you really are... that can be pretty scary.;;;;;;;;
1200;(Gunslinger Stratos: The Animation);Tooru Kazasumi;It has happened many times throughout history. Resources, territory, wealth... Humans fight each other in order to gain something they don't have. It's simple. How can you be concerned with the lives of others when you're about to starve to death? You're too naive. Humans can only live by stealing what they don't have from others. If there's no future, we just take the future from others.;;;;;;;;
1201;(Grisaia no Rakuen);Amane Suou;All I ever gained from abandoning something and running away were regrets I couldn't do anything about, and a version of myself that could only resent others. If I come to hate myself, even living becomes a sin. Remorse alone will become my punishment. That's why I've decided to take action of my own free will, so I'll never have the same regrets again.;;;;;;;;
1202;(Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata);Tomoya Aki;They're human beings who are more appealing that real girls with warm blood flowing through their veins! That's what you have to be!;;;;;;;;

1205;(Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata);Tomoya Aki;"You're the idiot. 3D girls are way too much trouble. The first is ""the most beautiful girl in school"", which is a dating sim trope that doesn't exist in reality. The second is having two of the ""most beautiful girl in school"" is contradictory. And the third is the wildly mistaken notion that a 2D-only otaku like me could possibly have a 3D girlfriend.";;;;;;;;
1206;(Mikagura School Suite);Imizu Asuhi;Even a dim star is sending light somewhere.;;;;;;;;
1207;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;It's arrogant to think just saying things out loud is enough. Self-gratifying on the part of the speaker, and conceited on the part of the listener. You won't always come to an understanding by talking things out.;;;;;;;;
1208;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;"Expecting others to read your mind is delusional. But... But... I... I...""It's not empty words I'm after. There was something else I desired all along. Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship, or anything of the sort. I don't care about being understood. I simply wish to understand. Understand, know, and rest easy in that knowledge-- gain some peace of mind. Wanting to know people inside-out because being in the dark terrifies me is an awfully self-indulgement, egoistic, and arrogant wish. It's downright despicable and disgusting. Having a desire like that makes me sick to the stomach! But if it's at all possible to share that desire-- if it's possible to have a relationship where you're free to burden one another with that repulsive self-gratification...I know that it's out of the question! I know that it's out of my reach! Even so!"" Even so, I... I want something genuine. ";;;;;;;;

1210;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Monokuma;You know, isn't it said that life has its ups and downs? It's fun because downs come after ups, but if life was full of downs, wouldn't it get boring?;;;;;;;;

1216;(Eden*);Natsume;Even now, she continues to burn away her life in order to bring about a beginning rather than an end... She just looks forward while dreaming of the outside world. But you know what I think? Isn't it a bad thing to just look forward? Sometimes looking to the side, or looking back... There just might be something important there. You may have lost something. There may be the smile of a loved one. Isn't it impotant to try looking around once in a while? That's how it was for me. I could only ever face forward, could only move my legs with reckless abandon. I never had any idea what sort of footprints I might be leaving behind me. No, in truth, I couldn't even look ahead. The fact that I've never seen anything was scary... so I went on a trip to find what I truly desired.;;;;;;;;
1217;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;That's not love... A heroine's love is supposed to be sincere! If you can immediately move on and find someone new, it isn't love!;;;;;;;;

1231;(The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan);Asakura Ryouko;Applying knowledge is of the utmost importance when studying. You wrestle with various things and come up with a solution from there. It's true that asking someone who knows the answer is the quickest. But you can't necessarily say that that's the best way, don't you think?;;;;;;;;
1232;(Psycho-Pass Extended Edition);Makishima Shougo;Overall, I think people tend to reveal their true selves when they step into an avatar. As I said earlier, they probably feel some sense of freedom. But freedom easily gained quickly turns into a false sense of omnipotence.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
1235;(Grisaia no Rakuen);Matsushima Michiru;I don't like sparklers all that much. It burns so beautifully for just a little while and when it's done, only black cinders remain. It's like a misbegotten life and it makes me feel lonely for no good reason.;;;;;;;;

1240;(Psycho-Pass Extended Edition);Makishima Shougo;Most people don’t mind killing cows and chickens but they’d probably have a hard time doing the same to chimpanzees. Partially, it’s because chimpanzees bear a slight resemblance to humans, but the primary reason is that they can draw pictures. Suppose fish were able to draw pictures. Even if we are unable to understand what they’re thinking, it becomes harder to kill animals that can draw. Instinctively, in our minds we would say to ourselves… “May be they have feelings” That shows how high a value we assign to expression.;;;;;;;;
1241;(Bleach: Official Character Book 3 UNMASKED);Ulquiorra Schiffer;"What is there, over there? There is nothing. I was born in a bottom of a pit where no light shone. As if pressed together by the darkness. Untouched by everything at all. Born under those dark, dark sediments. I had a white form. My comrades were all in pure black. In those black forms with their eyes shining and teeth baring they were certainly eating something. And then... There was nothing to me, except my eyes. I felt nothing. No rather... It was possible that what I felt was ""void"", yet. I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest. I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to ""void"" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great ""void"". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose. If that isn't ""happiness"", then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist. There is nothing... in you... and... in me.";;;;;;;;
1242;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Kyōko Kirigiri;Fear is proof that your imagination is functioning. Frankly, I feel bad for anyone who can't feel fear. Without imagination, you can never deduce which action to take next.;;;;;;;;

1244;(Shining Hearts);Madera;There's some skill involved in the creation of anything. That skill is like a map made of the failures people have made in the past and learned from. That map can guide people. If you follow a certain route you'll fail. However, if you follow a different route you'll succeed. You can make something just by following the map. It will take form. It might be very hard task to walk the way others have told you. But if you have the will, it might turn out to be easy. But if you follow the path created by others, you'll eventually have to stop somewhere. Then what will you do? Will you create a new path for yourself? Or will you wait until someone creates one for you? Either one is fine. Stopping or moving forward. Because the path you'll follow is something you have to choose for yourself.;;;;;;;;

Even if I am struck with a thousand setbacks... it does not serve as a reason to alter the way I live... my life!;;;;;;;;
1254;(Kekkai Sensen);Mary Macbeth;Don't you think it's futile to live in fear of death? I mean, everyone is going to die sometime, so is there any point in pretending not to see it for the present? Or instead, I wonder if they think it doesn't concern them, since they aren't going to die.;;;;;;;;

1256;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;Tests are a good thing. The knowledge gained from a night of cramming will be all but forgotten once you hit adulthood. And that's fine.

1257;(Psycho-Pass Extended Edition);Makishima Shougo;"Suppose someone said ""humans are foolish""... Obviously, that person would be talking about themselves as well. If you want to understand human beings, you need to do more than just watch them. You need to pay attention to what they themselves are watching. What are you watching? You are the ones who I'm watching. It may be hard to believe, but I like you guys. You know what they say... The opposite of love is not hatred, but indifference. An indifferent person would lack the drive to kill or hurt. My mind keeps jumping around. Am I nervous...? Did I underestimate my enemy so much that I stepped in too deep...? ...What a silly thought.";;;;;;;;
1258;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;It’s dangerous for them to grow up without experiencing true competition. Because they’ll keep whining, even without taking the matter seriously.

1271;(Air Gear);Ringo Noyamano;From this day on, I don't need freedom. As we struggle using our strength to grasp what's above us. We will eventually reach something, that is the meaning of the word freedom.;;;;;;;;
1272;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;A long time there... There was a balloon man, right? When I first heard that story, I was so stupid that I actually enjoyed it... But really, the story was horrible. Driven solely by his dreams he used his balloons to disapear into the sky. The people watching made a big fuss about it... But no one really tried to stop it. There's no telling where the wind will take you. And he knew that one day his fuel, his ''freedom'' would run out, and he'd fall into the black ocean. To fly... that feeling is the most important thing. But instead of the dark clouds that drive people from the sky... There must be a chain to keep them grounded. The time will come, for those with the ability to fly away, while everyone else can only watch. Using their own wings, their own power... soaring as far as they can without aid. Because... Because that is what it means to fly. ;;;;;;;;
1273;(Air Gear);Ringo Noyamano;The desire to fly with ''real wings'' is what motivates you.;;;;;;;;

And ironically, that taught me that the truth is not necessarily only one when I believed that only one truth existed. By just broadening my field of vision a little, I can see a truth that is completely different. And no matter which one of the truths, if you can only see one of them, they will not be the right answer...

If you manage to defeat him, then an even stronger person comes along. If you don't have the resolve to endure that eternal struggle, then eventually your confidence will erode. But it doesn't end there! The battle will continue elsewhere, fought by others. It's an endless cycle! And it doesn't end with a person's death. The cycle will continue!

1337;(Bleach);Don Kanonji;Run? Is that how you speak to a hero? How little you understand. Allow me to educate you. If a hero were to run from battle... the children could no longer call him a hero.;;;;;;;;
1338;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;It's been so long that I forgot the pain of not having a name. Everyone had a name that friends use to call them, but I didn't. That pain.;;;;;;;;
1339;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Hange Zoe;If there's something you don't understand, learn to understand it.;;;;;;;;
1340;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;You're not a good-for-nothing person. I think that being able to try your hardest to be something is a talent by itself.;;;;;;;;
1341;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Greed;Greed may not be good, but it’s not so bad either. You humans think greed is just for money or power, but everyone wants something they can’t have.;;;;;;;;
1342;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;How sad it would be if laughter should disappear.;;;;;;;;
1343;(Trinity Blood);Astharoshe Asran;It is so painful when you lose someone you love ...To the point where your hair turns white because of grief.;;;;;;;;
1344;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;Nothing can remain the same forever, because if you don't change you can't improve... Facing this inescapable ''reality'' if you don't grow... You'll be crushed... For everyone to ascend and accomplish their dreams. They must grow.;;;;;;;;
1345;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;I'm always alone. Other people don't factor into what I do. The things that happen in front of me are parts of my life and my life alone. ;;;;;;;;
1346;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;You're the one who decides who you are.;;;;;;;;

1348;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;If you don't get accepted by anyone, does that mean there's no significance for you to live on?;;;;;;;;
1349;(Cowboy Bebop);Vincent Volaju;I have no fear of death. It just means dreaming in silence. A dream that lasts for eternity;;;;;;;;
1350;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;[After getting hit by Yammy Llargo's Bala] You mean do I have a defence? Truth is, I’ve never really had any plans against any attacks. I just knew I had to win so I did. That’s my plan. I don’t care if you’re higher ranked than the other Espadas' were, to me it’s all the same. I’ve gotta defeat you so I’ll find a way to do it. Simple.;;;;;;;;
1351;(Assassination Classroom);Karma Akabane;If you’ve got time to point fingers, then how about using your head to figure out what you want to do about it?;;;;;;;;
1352;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;Food tastes best when you don't have to work for it. ;;;;;;;;
1353;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;Merits, demerits, risks, returns;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
Desire and self-protection; hatred from jealousy. I could analyze the mentality of the actions that were grounded on these abundant; repulsive emotions. That's because I had plenty of those ugly feelings inside of me. That's why it was simple to imagine. if they were similar things; then there was still room to understand it. I could explain using logic.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
However; if there wasn't; then it was difficult.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
Without the concept of profit and loss; it was hard to imagine the feelings of people who went beyond people who went beyond logic and theory. I had too little to go on and above all else. I had committed too many mistakes up until now.;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
Good will; friendship; or even love;;;;;;;;;
1354;(One thousand and one nights);Sehara;"When I thought that I would never see you again. I was crippled by the pain of my heart being shattered. For the first time, I came to realize that ""Heartbreak"" was not just a word in books.";;;;;;;;
1355;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai NEXT);Kodaka Hasegawa;You know what, I wish I could give everyone a happy ending. But life isn't some romantic anime and I can't fix what's wrong in life stumbling around being oblivious and nice all the time. ;;;;;;;;

1359;(Natsume's Book of Friends);Takashi Natsume;What's been troubling me lately are these small farewells that make me feel a bit lonely. Brief meetings and farewells. I want to treasure each and every moment.;;;;;;;;
1360;(Kuroko's Basketball TV 3);Akashi Seijuurou;"I have not changed at all. There were two of me to begin with. It was merely a swap between us. I have no intent on hiding this. Whether or not you believe it is up to you, Tetsuya. However, if you want to call it a ""change"", then that was because it was necessary. The team did not change because I had changed. I changed because the team had changed. ";;;;;;;;
1361;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;Humans, in general, feel uneasy when there’s dissonance between them and their external environment. And so, to cancel that uneasiness they try to synchronize (or make peace) with that environment.;;;;;;;;
1362;(Hunter X Hunter);Ging Freecss;If I can get my target to move as I want, I've succeeded as a Hunter.;;;;;;;;
1363;(Hunter X Hunter);Meruem;Ha-ha these humans are definitely foolish creatures.  Think as hard as those weak brains of yours can manage. Do you humans ever listen to the cries of mercy coming from pigs and cows you slaughter?;;;;;;;;

1366;(Rosario Vampire);Tsukune Aono;Our differences are what let us understand each other. We've worked together to come this far, there are no doubts or regret anymore. I'll overcome this fight and prove that even we can come to an understanding.;;;;;;;;
1367;(Giant Killing);Takeshi Tatsumi;Do your best, no matter how many times you fail!;;;;;;;;
1368;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Shinji Ikari;No one can justify life by linking happy moments into a rosary.;;;;;;;;
1369;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;It is a virtue to devote one's self to something, firmly believing in one's own ideals. But that does not mean it's alright to belittle the ideals or feelings of others. If you lead such a busy life and you don't realize how your parents feel, it's only self-satisfaction. It's alright to stop every now and again, if you want a moment's rest, if you want to feel what other people feel.;;;;;;;;
1370;(Kara no Kyoukai);Aozaki Touko;A rose will be born a rose. Different soil and water wouldn't change it into a different flower.;;;;;;;;
1371;(Serial Experiments Lain);Lain Iwakura;If you're not remembered, then you never existed.;;;;;;;;
1372;(Death Note);Mello;Oh, I almost forgot. In the event that anyone besides big-headed Near or the deluded murderer is reading these notes, then I should at least perform the basic courtesy of introducing myself, here at the end of the prologue. I am your narrator, your navigator, your storyteller. For anyone else but those two, my identity may be of no interest, but I am the old world's runner-up, the best dresser that died like a dog, Mihael Keehl. I once called myself Mello and was addressed by that name, but that was a long time ago.;;;;;;;;
1373;(Death Note);L Lawliet;There is no heaven or hell. No matter what you do while you're alive, everybody goes to the same place once you die. Death is Equal.  ;;;;;;;;
1374;(Air Gear);Rika Noyamano;From the past... I always wanted to ask. God, why... Are you so unfair and extremely cruel? Why do you separate those who can fly... And those who cannot and bring them into existence? Why, in this one world... You made the effort to divide them into two and bring them together? In reality everyone was born with wings!.. Why didn't I realize that until now? It's not that those who can fly are able to fly, but that those who think of flying... Those who believe they can fly are the ones who can fly.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
1376;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;If you've decided that you can't do it even before you act, you have already made it into something impossible.;;;;;;;;
1377;(Sekirei);Hayato Mikogami;This is exactly why I detest adults! You always have such a parochial approach, always trying to force the rules of your petty world onto others!;;;;;;;;
1378;(One thousand and one nights);Sehara;It takes more courage to speak the truth than it does to wield a sword.;;;;;;;;
1379;(Fairy Tail);Minerva Orland;Manipulating the pieces according to your strategy... That is what defines a King.;;;;;;;;
1380;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;Sure, it might be warm and comfortable in there... not only safe and sound, but I get all the meals too! But I'd rather be out than be trapped inside this bird cage of yours.;;;;;;;;
1381;(Air Gear);Rika Noyamano;No matter what kind of 'strength' you possess. There are places you can never reach no matter how hard you try. The farther it is... The higher it is...;;;;;;;;
1382;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Erwin Smith;If we only focus on making the best moves, we will never get the better of our opponent. When necessary, we must be willing to take big risks, and be prepared to lose everything. Unless we change how we fight, we cannot win.;;;;;;;;
1383;(Psycho-Pass Extended Edition);Makishima Shougo;Aging is quite similar to death. Some people stand up to aging and death as if it were nothing. They can do it not because they're braver than others, but simply because they lack imagination. Only once people deny that which they love, do they become able to create it anew. Perhaps, the book I write, too, will die one day just like my body will. However, people have to accept that death is unavoidable. They will probably be gone in ten years. Their books will no longer exist in a hundred years. People accept this. Eternity is promised neither to humans nor to books. We live because we were born. If the system possesses the power of life and death over you... you're no longer a human. You're livestock. No matter how hard a rancher tries to pretend otherwise, they never recognize their livestock as friends. It's a mystery to me... How is it that these people, treated as livestock in this boring society, have not tried at all to destroy it? Nothing in this world is eternal. The only thing that truly exists is the splendor of the souls that atone for their sins.;;;;;;;;
1384;(One thousand and one nights);Sehara;You cannot understand that which you do not know, and that misunderstanding breeds hatred.;;;;;;;;

1386;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;"""To enjoy what one loves to do"". Those words come easily from the mouth. But it's another thing to help them grow.";;;;;;;;

1388;(Grisaia no Meikyuu);Yuuji Kazami;They say you never know when a bullet you fired in battle will find its way back to you.;;;;;;;;
1389;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;That's not exactly right. If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you're more likely to give up and throw it away. Including relationships you have in your hand now.;;;;;;;;
1390;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead);Ayumu Aikawa;Ah... Everything is such a bother. Even living.;;;;;;;;
1391;(Seiken Tsukai no World Break);Moroha Haimura;If you don't want to be taken from, stop taking.;;;;;;;;
1392;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;I don't give a damn about the real world.;;;;;;;;
1393;(Medaka Box);Hansode Shiranui;It's pointless to force people to do their best if they don't want to.;;;;;;;;
1394;(NANA);Nana Komatsu;No matter how much we think we want - it's never enough. I just want one thing to go right for me. I just need something to give me the energy so I can keep going.;;;;;;;;
1395;(One Piece);Trafalgar Law;You can't see the whole picture until you look at it from the outside.;;;;;;;;
1396;(Arashi no Yoru ni);Mei;Life eventually ends. But that doesn't mean that the fact that we met, or the time we spent together will disappear.;;;;;;;;
1397;(NANA);Nana Komatsu;Why is it that making our dreams come true, and being truly happy are often two separate things?.. I still haven't figured that one out.;;;;;;;;
1398;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Furudo Erika;Without love, people could exist without knowing truth and falsehood. By knowing it, they cry and grief and get lost. I was the same back then.;;;;;;;;
1399;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Virgilia;Real magic is the power to repair, to revive. To call back happiness which has disappeared, to call back love which has gotten cold. And it can call back a forgotten smile to a princess' face.;;;;;;;;
1400;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Kyrie;They often say that stupid thoughts are no better than sleeping.;;;;;;;;
1401;(Kagerou Days);Enomoto Takane;When people immerse themselves in their own world and other people around them start doing something, they can’t help but feel very lonely.;;;;;;;;
1402;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;No matter how small the problem is, how small the thing is, it always affects the people around you.;;;;;;;;
1403;(Hibike! Euphonium);Kawashima Sapphire;Music speaks to people's hearts, all throughout the world. I believe it's a powerful language.;;;;;;;;
1404;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;There are some people who don't want a solution. Some want things to stay the way they are. There's no way to make things convenient for everyone. So the only option is to find a compromise.;;;;;;;;
1405;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Having people acknowledge your existence is a wonderful thing.;;;;;;;;
1406;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;The opposite of boredom is not pleasure... but excitement. People will gladly seek out any kind of excitement, even pain.;;;;;;;;
1407;(Air Gear);Akito Wanijima;The frog in the well can't communicate with the ocean creatures, as it knows the depth of the sky. It's because the frog lived inside a cramped and small space, so he knows better than anyone, how precious freedom is.;;;;;;;;
1408;(Hunter x Hunter 2011);Kurapika;There are two things that collectors always want. The first is any item of extreme rarity. The second is colleagues to whom they can brag about their collection.;;;;;;;;
1409;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;A person's mentality and feelings aren't always equal. There are times the conclusion you arrive at is completely irrational and the reason is because of that.;;;;;;;;
1410;(NANA);Yasushi Takagi;In the end, people are all alone, and no matter how close they cling together, they can never be one. It's impossible to make someone belong to you.;;;;;;;;
1411;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;A perfect plan doesn't mean having everything go within expectations. A perfect plan is achieved when it has the plasticity needed to flexibly deal with troubles.;;;;;;;;
1412;(Accel World);Fuuko Kurasaki;A scar indicates that something is missing. You lost something important, and there's a hole in your heart. Having that empty hole can lead to anger, hate, despair, or... it can make you reach for the sky.;;;;;;;;
1413;(Accel World);Kuroyukihime;A clever retreat? Throw that to the dogs! Once you've dived into the battlefield, you can only devote yourself to the fight, regardless of your opponent!;;;;;;;;
1414;(Magi: Adventure of Sinbad);Sinbad;"It's impossible to share everything. No one can become someone else. It's natural to envy someone who's more wealthy or who has higher standing. That's how conflicts begin. However, being blissfully unaware of this, relying on whatever someone provided without thinking, and only seeing things as ""black"" or ""white"" with such overly simplified thinking... Isn't that a sin as well? People need to think for themselves. For this reason, someone ""grey"", someone between ""black"" and ""white"" is essential. I will not gloss over the flaws in my ideals. It's not possible for all of mankind to share the same kind of thoughts. However, everyone is capable of thought. Everyone can learn, share, and decide with their own strength. A world built upon an understanding of that. If this is a ""dream"", if I don't realize it, who will?";;;;;;;;
1415;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Your happiness is your own business. Its a promise you make to yourself. It is a reward you give yourself for accomplishing what you set out to do, for achieving what you strive for. But if you fail to reward yourself for what you have accomplished, then you are essentially breaking a promise to yourself. Its like a breach of contract, compensation must always be made. You must pay all of the debts that you made, even to yourself.;;;;;;;;
1416;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Hanyuu;I'm prepared for anything! Up until now, I have been running away from every fight, afraid of losing. But running away is even worse than losing. Unless one continues to fight, without succumbing to the pain of defeat, it is impossible to achieve victory. That is what people I love taught me.;;;;;;;;
1417;(Death Parade);Chiyuki;I'm sure it's not wrong for people to want to understand each other. And even if it is, I want us to understand each other.;;;;;;;;
1418;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Satou Tatsuhiro;Question: Why can one keep living as a hikikomori?;;;;;;;;
Answer: Because one's food; clothing and shelter are assured. It's because one is permitted a lukewarm bare minimum of a life that one can keep living as a hikikomori indefinitely. Being able to live as a hikikomori was in itself very much a luxury. Without the assurance of food; clothing and shelter; unless you're prepared to die;" there's no other way but to work.""";;;;;;;
1419;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Furudo Erika;All truth is meaningless. In the end, 'meaning' comes from the mind of each individual human. Even when there is a single truth, it can mean different things to different individuals. The truth has no meaning in itself!;;;;;;;;
1420;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Lambdadelta;There’s only one difference between heroes and mad men. It’s whether they win or lose.;;;;;;;;
1421;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Ange;No person can become a replacement for another. Not even the past version of themselves.;;;;;;;;

1423;(Ao no Exorcist);Fujimoto Shirou;You'll never be able to move forward if you're afraid of soiling your hands.;;;;;;;;
1424;(Velvet Blue Rose);Ageha Shiroi;When you love someone, sometimes your head hurts. And it's so agonizing that you want to burst into tears. But even the smallest thing can bring you happiness. It's complicated, but simple. Perhaps all these emotions are irreplaceable and precious.;;;;;;;;
1425;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Beatrice;You can catch a mouse that's shut in a cage. However, catching a mouse in a field is like trying to catch a cloud.;;;;;;;;
1426;(Toaru Kagaku no Railgun);Mikoto Misaka;Why not just try hard again? Quit mopping around. Stop lying to yourself and try once more.;;;;;;;;
1427;(Bakuman);Akito Takagi;If I follow my dream and it shatters - I can accept having to regret that. But I don't want to regret not pursuing it in the first place.;;;;;;;;
1428;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Ange;Even if you have two of the exact same person, they could change enormously depending on their upbringing.;;;;;;;;
1429;(Monster);Johann Liebert;Tell me, what do you think is the ultimate fear? I really thought I'd already reached the darkest of the dark, but then, ahead of me, I beheld a darkness even greater still.;;;;;;;;
1430;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;Most non-NEET people in the world don't realize that human nature isn't scalar, but vectorial.;;;;;;;;
1431;(Houkago no Pleiades);Subaru;If there's no eye to see, there's no difference between the darkness and the light.;;;;;;;;
1432;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;If you could calculate feelings, then we'd be in a digital age by now... The remaining answer that you couldn't calculate is what they call the feelings of people.;;;;;;;;
1433;(Ao Haru Ride);Touma Kikuchi;Change can only arise from fluctuations, right? That's why going back and forth between confidence and weakness, if you're shifting then you're changing, I think. Like that, little by little, everyone is changing probably.;;;;;;;;
1434;(Tokyo Ghoul);Juuzou Suzuya;If an angelic being fell from the sky and tried to live in this world of ours, I think even they would commit many wrongs.;;;;;;;;
1435;(Magi: Adventure of Sinbad);Sinbad;Don't be frightened by the waves. If we read the flow of the waves and accept them, we can overcome it. There's no wave that can't be overcome!!;;;;;;;;
1436;(Air Gear);Agito Wanijima;To reach the top we must crush their dreams and climb atop their shattered hopes. The will to win at any cost, to obliterate the enemy if necessary, without ambition there is no way to move up.;;;;;;;;
1437;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;Does the world hate me or something? I've always rejected it in an exceedingly friendly manner.;;;;;;;;
1438;(Air Gear);Rika Noyamano;In truth everyone gets their wings the day they are born, and if one has the courage to spread those wings, then he'll fly for sure;;;;;;;;
1439;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;
1440;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Shizuka Hiratsuka;Don't understand? Then think more. If you can only think by calculating, then keep doing so until you can't. Think of all the answers you can and destroy them one by one with the process of elimination. Whatever remains is your answer.;;;;;;;;
1441;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;Keep flying higher so that others are inspired to fly with you.;;;;;;;;
1442;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Erwin Smith;If you begin to regret, you'll dull your future decisions and let others make your choices for you. All that's left for you then is to die. Nobody can foretell the outcome. Each decision you make holds meaning only by affecting your next decision.;;;;;;;;
1443;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Everyone has something they hold dear, something they never want to lose. That's why they pretend. That's why they hide the truth. And that's why they lie.;;;;;;;;
1444;(Death Parade);Ginti;Humans all behave the same way, like idiots. They all forget that someday, they're gonna die, so the moment they come face to face with death, they cling to life.;;;;;;;;
1445;(Devil May Cry);Dante;It's a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.;;;;;;;;
1446;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Yozora Mikazuki;It makes you sad when someone suddenly just up and disappears without a word. If you're just going to end up hurt in the end, you're better off not forming any bonds at all.;;;;;;;;
1447;(Houkago no Pleiades);Subaru;Even shining stars that seem very close are actually far, far apart, separated by many light years. Perhaps we're like the stars we all gaze upon, shining alone in the empty void of space. Having faith that one day, our light might reach someone.;;;;;;;;
1448;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yūzan Yoshida;If you don't hold any regret in your choice, that means you must've made the right decision.;;;;;;;;

1453;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;If you're gonna have great happiness, it requires great effort in exchange, that's called compensation. For the good things in life, there are the bad. For the bad things in life, there are always the good. In order for you to be happy, you must be willing to accept a burden of a equal amount of unhappiness in exchange as your payment. The more you achieve, the greater the demands will be placed upon you in return.;;;;;;;;
1454;(Death Parade);Death Parade;There aren't many things you can believe. That's how human beings work. They only care about themselves, and no one else really matters. They get caught up in their own lackadaisical dialogue, lying their way through life.;;;;;;;;
1455;(Neko no Machi no Ko);Shiro;I wanted to be a cat. I was jealous of them. They're liked by everyone... Even though they don't do anything at all. I just wanted everyone to like me.;;;;;;;;

1458;(Bakemonogatari);Bakemonogatari;Oddities are the world itself. They're linked to the world, unlike living beings. Science alone cannot shed light upon them, as there will always be people who'll be afraid of vampires. Although all forms of darkness could be lit up, darkness will never cease to exist.;;;;;;;;
1459;(Bleach);Hollow Ichigo;I'm going to keep getting closer and closer to you. And not just day after day, oh no. It's going to happen much faster than that! See I'm already closer to you than I was a moment ago. And I'll keep getting closer and closer to you, until I swallow you up and then, you'll disappear. Things are not turning out well for you at all, are they? (laughs) See you around.;;;;;;;;
1460;(Naruto Shippūden: Kizuna);Shinnou;People are weak. They have no fangs or claws. All they can do is cry. And yet, how was it that this world came into the possession of humans? That's because...  among all living things... they are... the cruelest!;;;;;;;;
1461;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;In order to measure a person’s worth, you must do more than push them. The real way to test their worth is to give them power. When they gain the freedom to act outside the boundaries of law and ethics, you can sometimes see their souls. When the weak become strong... When good citizens become free to engage in violence... I'm interested to see what is the outcome of that.;;;;;;;;

1463;(Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. Zoku);Hachiman Hikigaya;School trips are simply a simulation of adult social life. If you ever go on a business trip with your boss, you won't get to choose where to stay or what to eat, but if you compromise, you can still have a modicum of fun. School trips train you to trick yourself into that kinda mindset.;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
1470;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;There is a history to humans. Humans are shaped by the experience obtained from living as time continued to wind and wind. To be reborn meant being rid of that history;;;;;;;;

1472;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Frederica Bernkastel;You're nothing but a piece. Your absence wouldn't hinder my progress in this game in the slightest. If you can't think of any other theories in particular, please just go back to the piece tray and gather dust or something. It's painful to even remember useless pieces.;;;;;;;;
1473;(ib: Instant Bullet);Kuro Fukase;Any event is a personal episode, where only those involved comprehend what's happening.;;;;;;;;
1474;(One Piece);Sanji;I couldn't confess my feelings for you, so I watched you from afar, being happy with someone else.;;;;;;;;
1475;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Kyrie;What if that fruit you've worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning? You'll regret that you didn't choose to harvest it the previous day instead of complaining. That regret really hurts. It'll make you crawl through hell.;;;;;;;;
1476;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Kyrie;Love really is like playing with fire. Anyone can play easily and lightheartedly. But when you mess up and get burned, that scar stays with you your whole life.;;;;;;;;
1477;(Psycho-Pass);Kougami Shinya;When something impossible happens, there are only two possibilities. Either your assumptions are wrong, or you have gone crazy.;;;;;;;;
1478;(One Piece);Boa Hancock;Whether I kick a kitten... Tear off your ears... Even slaughter innocent people... The world will never cease to forgive my actions! Why, you ask? That's right, it is because I am... Beautiful!!! ;;;;;;;;
1479;(Kuroko No Basket);Taiga Kagami;The only times we're fated to lose are in fictional stories. This is our drama! We decide what the plot will be!;;;;;;;;
1480;(Death Parade);Nona;The truth is, there are no lives that are nothing but pretty.;;;;;;;;
1481;(Tamako Love Story);Tamako Love Story;The present will always be different from the past. That's what makes life good and at the same time sad. That sadness in turn gives our everyday life some flavor. Just like coffee.;;;;;;;;
1482;(Tamako Love Story);Tamako Love Story;Youth is fleeting. Young people can't even wait for a spoonful of sugar to dissolve and bitter regret is proof of that. But by bit, you get a taste for it.;;;;;;;;
1483;(Kuroshitsuji: Book of Murder);Sebastian Michaelis;Yes, my lord. I devote my entire being to you. Until the day... that lies become truth.;;;;;;;;
1484;(Akatsuki no Yona);Ik-su;No matter how foolish or incomprehensible, some love cannot be discarded. You may try to stop your heart, unable to forgive yourself, but there will be times when you lose hope and your heart is moved again.;;;;;;;;
1485;(Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus);Sebastian Michaelis;Unlike demons, you’re base, you harbor a complicated malice, you lie… You struggle desperately, knocking down others in your way… You steal and are stolen from, you make endless excuses… And still you strive to get over the hill and far away. I suppose that’s why humans are so interesting.;;;;;;;;
1486;(Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus);Ciel Phantomhive;Don't cry;;;;;;;;
1487;(Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus);Ciel Phantomhive;Words are cheap. There's no guarantee she won't tell anyone. Humans lie without a second thought. Including me, of course.;;;;;;;;
1488;(Haibane Renmei);Rakka;Somewhere, that’s not here, in a place I can’t remember, I was obsessed with the idea that I was all alone. I thought that nobody would care, or even miss me if I vanished from the face of the Earth. I wanted to disappear. Then I had a dream about falling from the sky. I just remember that the bird was in the dream with me, and that the bird was someone in the form of a bird, trying to call me back. I now know that I was never alone.;;;;;;;;
1489;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;A lump of steel, like a shooting star. Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different. I swing between hope and despair at your slightest gesture, and my heart starts to play a melody. What kind of feeling is this again? What do they call this kind of feeling? I think it's probably... Called Love. I'm sure this is what they call love.;;;;;;;;
1490;(CLANNAD);Ichinose Kotomi;Those who seek out the truth must not be arrogant. You must not laugh at miracles just because they cannot be explained scientifically. You must not turn away from the beauty of this world.;;;;;;;;
1491;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;Isn't it funny how the most unforgettable scenes can be so trivial ?  ;;;;;;;;
1492;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;Everyone will always question your ideals. That's simply reality.;;;;;;;;
1493;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;Hold on. Don't go! Let's argue again. I'll bribe you with a canelé. I'll call you to kill time. I don't mind being Friend A. Please don't go. Please don't go. Please don't go...please don't leave me behind.;;;;;;;;
1494;(Aldnoah.Zero);Inaho Kaizuka;Giving in to despair is a foolish choice.;;;;;;;;
1495;(Puella Magi Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Do you value your life? Do you think that your family and friends are important to you? If they are, then you should never think of changing yourself. Otherwise, you will lose everything that is precious to you.;;;;;;;;
1496;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;I just long for a world in which ordinary things are done in an ordinary way.;;;;;;;;
1497;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;If you keep bad-mouthing someone, you might feel like as if you are on a higher position than that person. But in actual fact, its completely wrong to do that!;;;;;;;;
1498;(Naruto);Gaara;Just because someone is important to you, it doesn't necessarily mean that, that person is good. Even if you knew that person was evil... People cannot win against their loneliness.;;;;;;;;
1499;(Haikyuu!!);Ittetsu Takeda;When 'colors' mix, they become muddy and messy. But when they all blend together, the final result is the color that wins against all others... Black.;;;;;;;;
1500;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Shinichi Izumi;"In the end, I couldn't see things from the parasites' perspective, never mind from Migi's. Of course not. It wasn't possible from the beginning. As two different species, we may at times take advantage of each other and kill each other, but it's impossible to understand each other. Actually, you shouldn't even think that you've figured out another species based on your standards. I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a ""friend"" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right. So in the end, it's hypocritical for us to love Earth without loving ourselves.";;;;;;;;
1501;(Psychic Detective Yakumo);Makoto Hijikata;Even if it doesn't pay off or you're laughed at, go down the path that you believe is right.;;;;;;;;
1502;(Psychic Detective Yakumo);Isshin Saitō;All humans are loved by another and build up emotions with them. That's nature's providence. There's no way around it. And it's pointless to question it. A bug with wings has no idea why, but it can't help but want to fly. When two people can't help but seek one another out, I think, in essence, it's exactly the same scenario.;;;;;;;;
1503;(Psychic Detective Yakumo);Yakumo Saitō;Every human has another personality that they keep hidden from others.;;;;;;;;
1504;(Death Parade);Tatsumi;In order to accomplish anything, sacrifices must be made.;;;;;;;;
1505;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Ange;No idiot would want to be friends with an unmoving, unspeaking telephone pole. However, unmoving and unspeaking is exactly what you'd want from a telephone pole.;;;;;;;;
1506;(Bakuman);Moritaka Mashiro;Those who don't give up no matter how many walls they run into, those are the ones who'll make their dreams come true.;;;;;;;;
1507;(Dragon Ball Z);Vegeta;*To Android 19* Just as I thought... you're nothing. Silly robot, you really think you have a chance against a super saiyan like me? Your brain must be malfunctioning. Fresh out of the factory with no warranty and already broken. What a pity.;;;;;;;;
1508;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;I led me by the hand, as if to fill the niches in the memories in my oozing brain fluid. Without even a destination, we kept walking. Disgusting clouds were floating in the sky. I already know what will happen to me the next time I wake up.;;;;;;;;
1509;(Tokyo Ghoul);Tokyo Ghoul;The bird fights it's way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born, must first destroy a world.;;;;;;;;
1510;(Bakuman);Moritaka Mashiro;Manga that's born from people taking responsibility for their own work, banging their head in frustration, feeling cornered, and like they want to escape, and then using that extreme situation, mental ability, stamina, and panic to create... would never lose to some soul-less manga that's just made up of other people's ideas without any kind of resolve!;;;;;;;;
1511;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Ange;Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skip for three days in a row, it'd be really hard to convince yourself to go back.;;;;;;;;
1512;(Kino No Tabi);The Author;Classification of fantasy and reality is itself a fantasy that humans created... Life begins when you make a distinction between yourself and others. From that moment on, the world becomes a stage for the story in which you are the main character. All humans live in a fantasy in which they are the main character. But the world doesn't recognize you as the main character at all. What nonsense. Everyone lives their entire life tormented by this confusion. There's only one way out of this hell. To place yourself in a position that is neither the main character nor a supporting role. In other words, the author.;;;;;;;;
1513;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Happiness depends on each person. If you think you're happy, then you must be happy.;;;;;;;;
1514;(Monster);Inspector Lunge;Even a child that receives one bit of praise has the ability to excel in a single talent, and those who receive regular encouragement can feel confidence, achieve success, and become leading members of society. Because they don’t believe they are worthless, they don’t need to raise a fist and have vengeance against fate or the world at large…;;;;;;;;
1515;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Curiosity is like a cockroach. It likes to stumble upon secrets that are supposed to stay hidden. ;;;;;;;;
1516;(ib: Instant Bullet);Kuro Fukase;"Let go of me. It'll all be in vain anyway. No matter how gently you hold onto me. No matter what kind of expression you look at me with. In the end, you guys are... only my imagination. I have a slight addiction to fantasy. I sometimes mix the reality that I don't want to face with warm illusions. That's why I can think of ""that"" as one of those moments.";;;;;;;;
1517;(07 Ghost);Labrador;True happiness comes from overcoming suffering. No one can shoulder your burdens for you.;;;;;;;;
1518;(Persona 3 The Movie #1 Spring of Birth);Minato Arisato;Is dying that scary to you?;;;;;;;;
1519;(Rakuen Tsuihō - Expelled from Paradise);Zarik Kajiwara;The first one to panic is the first one to lose. No matter if they're the hunter or the hunted.;;;;;;;;
1520;(Dice: The Cube That Changes Everything);Dong Taebin;Just because you look a little better, everyone comes running at you screaming and pretending to be friendly... Just because you look a little worse, everyone ignores you and uses you as a plaything or a slave... Isn't life so unfair?;;;;;;;;
1521;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;I... don't know why I'm alive. I have no reason to live. I have no interest in others. Living without concern for others... That's the way to live. Working a job that earns me just enough to eat... A life like that was enough...;;;;;;;;
1522;(Dice: The Cube That Changes Everything);Dongtae;The world is very boring. Everyone tries to live like a normal person without a second thought.;;;;;;;;
1523;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;Maybe... just maybe, the light can reach even the bottom of a dark ocean.;;;;;;;;
1524;(Akatsuki no Yona);Jae-ha;If you simply obey orders without question to protect your master, that isn't your greatest wish, but your greatest tragedy.;;;;;;;;
1525;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;My life after losing her... Is it over as well? The days I spent satisfied with the happiness I never noticed... Those times had passed away. For me... There's nothing left at all.;;;;;;;;
1526;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;"You're you. ""To be like you..."" - it's not so ambiguous as that. No matter what you do, no matter how you change, it doesn't mean a thing. you're just you, no matter what.";;;;;;;;
1527;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;Sure I'm okay. Because that's how I was built, after all.;;;;;;;;
1528;(Rakuen Tsuihō - Expelled from Paradise);Frontier Setter;When receiving an illogical favor from others, one should do the same to return the illogical favor.;;;;;;;;
1529;(Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core);Zack Fair;Embrace your dreams...and whatever happens, protect your honor...AS SOLDIER!;;;;;;;;
1530;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;Watching TV or playing games alone is more fun. Playing along with your friends' hobbies... Laughing at their jokes when they're not funny... All that does is tire me out.;;;;;;;;
1531;(Kino No Tabi);Kino;Whenever people see birds flying through the sky, it's said that they get the urge to go on a journey.;;;;;;;;

1534;(Bleach);Hollow Ichigo;"You can't spell ""slaughter"" without ""laughter.""";;;;;;;;
1535;(Tamako Market);Dera Mochimazzi;The year may end, but some things never do. You may not see them with your eyes, but when you look with your heart, you can.;;;;;;;;
1536;(Persona 4);Teddie;The truth is unattainable. It will always be shrouded in fog. Though you reach the murk and the gloom to grasp something, you have no means to know it is the truth. In which case, why...? What sense is there in yearning for the truth? Close your eyes. Lie to yourself. Live in blissful ignorance... it is a much smarter way to exist.;;;;;;;;
1537;(Highschool Of The Dead);Saeko Busujima;Protecting a man’s pride… is a woman’s duty. ;;;;;;;;
1538;(Death Parade);Decim;I say... that people do not live just so that they can someday die. It is because they are alive that they someday die. There is no point to living. The same goes for judgment. Judgment must be performed hand in hand with both life and death. It is something that must be performed hand in hand with humans.;;;;;;;;
1539;(Tokyo Ghoul);Irimi Kaya;I know I haven't always made the right decisions up to now... Whether I was right, or whether I was wrong, may not even matter in the first place. However, running up against my sins like this-- all of the choices I've made up to this point-- today, being able to die for someone-- is something I'm glad for... ;;;;;;;;
1540;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;So ephemeral and weak. But its shining with all its might. Thump, Thump, like a heartbeat. This is the light of life.;;;;;;;;
1541;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;After the first note resonated through the hall, You became everything I yearn for.;;;;;;;;
1542;(Hunter x Hunter 2011);Hisoka;Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.;;;;;;;;
1543;(Highschool Debut);Haruna Nagashima;Of course I'm insecure. Of course I'm lonely. Of course I wanna see him. And of course being so far apart sucks, but the thing is, nobody else could ever take his place. So it doesn't matter if I don't want a long-distance relationship. I don't have a choice, but I have to do it. I love him.;;;;;;;;
1544;(Mirai Nikki);Gasai Yuno;I'm selfish, I know. But to keep you only mine, I will do everything I needed to do, even if it's illegal. ;;;;;;;;
1545;(Naruto);Pain;Even the most ignorant, innocent child will eventually grow up as they learn what true pain is. It affects what they say, what they think… and they become real people. ;;;;;;;;
1546;(Death Note);Light Yagami;In this world, there are very few people who actually trust each other.;;;;;;;;
1547;(Hotarubi no Mori e);Hotaru Takegawa;Time might separate us some day. But, even still, until then, let's stay together.;;;;;;;;
1548;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Forgetting is like a wound. The wound may heal but it has already left a scar.;;;;;;;;
1549;(One Piece);Nami;Life is like a pencil that will surely run out, but will leave the beautiful writing of life.;;;;;;;;
1550;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Kindness can sometime translate to hostility.;;;;;;;;
1551;(Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi);Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière;I don't want to die, either. But I'm an aristocrat. It's an honor to die for one's people. You make fun of it, but is it that insignificant to die for everyone else?;;;;;;;;
1552;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;One ought to experience loneliness at least once or twice in life. No, you have to experience it. The idea of being chained to another person without reprieve is far more abnormal and disquieting. One has no choice but to learn about loneliness. I’m sure some things can’t be experienced without it.;;;;;;;;
1553;(Zero no Tsukaima: Princess no Rondo);Saito Hiraga;It's only natural for a man to protect the girl he likes.;;;;;;;;
1554;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;If there are things you learn with friends, there must also be things you learn without friends. They must be of equal worth, two sides of the same coin.;;;;;;;;

1558;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Battler;The longer the days go by without them, the worse the sadness from losing someone gets...;;;;;;;;
1559;(Monster);Mikhail Petrov;What is education? Isn't education meant to create a person that conforms to society? What kind of education must be administrated to create a human being that meets the society's demands? Education is an experiment.;;;;;;;;
1560;(Air);Minagi Tohno;Is there any purpose to wings that can't fly?;;;;;;;;
1561;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Hibari Kyoya;There is nothing less amusing than destroying those who have no will to live.;;;;;;;;
1562;(Haikyuu!!);Daichi Sawamura;We'll never win if we don't believe we can.;;;;;;;;
1563;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;Such a cruel boy. Telling me to dream one more time. I thought I was satisfied because my dream had come true... And I'd told myself it was enough... Yet here you are, watering this withered heart again.;;;;;;;;
1564;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Riza Hawkeye;War does not determine who is right - only who is left.;;;;;;;;
1565;(Monster);Wolfgang Grimmer;It's impossible for humans to forget their emotions.;;;;;;;;
1566;(Oyasumi Punpun);Masumi Seki;With such nice weather, I start thinking about useless things much more than usual. Humans are free. Although we can’t fly through the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We can sleep when we’re sleepy. We are free to start or stop anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going on all over the world. …What can we do to make everyone happy? Of course that’s impossible for me to know. If the answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I’m sure that there’s nothing that can make everyone happy. Happiness is relative, and that’s how people want it. Evil is also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to protect their child. Yet it’s usually seen as admirable. But when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out. Isn't it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I thinking? The world isn't going to change no matter what I think. Then what should I be doing? I don’t really want to do anything. I don’t want to order nor trouble anyone. That’s just laziness, I guess. I don’t go to school nor do I work and I've been wasting my time away since noon. Look at me, talking about the freedom of humans when I’m just some suspicious punk in this town. In conclusion, I have nothing.;;;;;;;;
1567;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;All this time, I've lived in hope of telling you how sorry I am, I've fought armies, just to have this chance, but now, there's nothing I can say.. That's good enough.;;;;;;;;
1568;(Black Bullet);Rentaro Satomi;Just what is right and what is wrong...? To begin with, just who is the enemy I must defeat?;;;;;;;;
1569;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Yotsugi Ononoki;To ask is a moment's shame. Not to, lifelong.;;;;;;;;
1570;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;If you lose something, just build it again. And this time, with a greater care.;;;;;;;;
1571;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;The piano is meant to be played like you're embracing it, right?;;;;;;;;
1572;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Yotsugi Ononoki;But still... Not trying to undo misunderstandings is the same as telling a lie.;;;;;;;;
1573;(Sankarea);Rea Sanka;If my own happiness will lead the misfortune of others then being unhappy is probably the wisest choice. ;;;;;;;;
1574;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Hiroko Seto;We're all connected. Just like the notes are intermittently connected. It's shared by us all. Through music, with the people you know, with the people you don't know, with all the people in this world. ;;;;;;;;
1575;(Boogiepop Phantom);Boogiepop;Human nature denies the past in order to justify the present. But do you believe there is anything in the present worth justifying?;;;;;;;;

1578;(Baccano!);Claire Stanfield;There's no such thing as a limit on being the best. You can always go for more. That's what it means to be human. No... That's what it means to be me.;;;;;;;;
1579;(Death Parade);Chiyuki;It's not just grief. There are as many emotions as there are people. The fragility of someone who lets their anger get the best of them... The strength to overcome fear because of love... You can't comprehend anything about them.;;;;;;;;
1580;(CLANNAD);Yoshino Yūsuke;Keep on living your life in such a way that love doesn't fade away. I shall work... so that love may shine brightly, even today.;;;;;;;;
1581;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya George;You need three types of power to control the world. One is influence. One is wealth. The third is... force.;;;;;;;;

1583;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Battler;Victory isn't something you are given. It is something you take.;;;;;;;;
1584;(Tokyo Ghoul);Touka Kirishima;There's no way someone who can't even protect himself can protect anyone else, is there?;;;;;;;;
1585;(Death Parade);Nona;Do you know what the most primitive emotion people have is? It’s fear.;;;;;;;;
1586;(Death Parade);Chiyuki;People aren't as complex as you think they are. They're simple, and they get sad or angry over simple things. That's how they are. They're quickly affected by the littlest things, and live without knowing where they're going to fall down. That's who people are!;;;;;;;;
1587;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Oomine Daiya;Only someone that's prepared to devote oneself to others' happiness, without caring about his own, is allowed to become a king.;;;;;;;;

1589;(Death Parade);Death Parade;Country of birth, time period, parents, location... various factors make people's lives unequal from the very beginning. ;;;;;;;;
1590;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya George;Fortitude is about staying cool and calmly analyzing your opponent. Do you know why? It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you, to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off, to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, thoroughly beat them until they can't get up!;;;;;;;;
1591;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Jessica;No matter how hard someone's heart is, if you keep on talking to them, little by little, it'll eventually start to crack! I believe it! I believe that useless effort doesn't exist in this world!;;;;;;;;

1611;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;Those who know despair, once knew hope. Those who know loss, once knew love.;;;;;;;;
1612;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Battler;Well, who you love depends on the person. Isn't everything fine as long as it's someone who's fun to be with? Being with someone doesn't require any permission as long as the two people accept each other. If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose. Don't forget that. You can't go out with someone with incomplete feelings.;;;;;;;;
1613;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Ange;Criticism of yourself as you're observed by others doesn't matter. If your existence is firmly acknowledged by you yourself, that's enough. If you can live with confidence in yourself, surely you can accept any kind of lifestyle.;;;;;;;;
1614;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Ushiromiya Maria;Truth can change its form depending on the observer.;;;;;;;;
1615;(Hyouka);Fuyumi Irisu;Those with talent who aren't aware of themselves cause pain for those who have none.;;;;;;;;
1616;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Sakamoto Yuuji;You have to fool your own people before you try to bluff the enemy.;;;;;;;;
1617;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Asou Renji;Human beings are cruel. Even though it's heartbreaking, I feel hungry. Even though it's painful, I feel sleepy. And, even though it's painful for me, I still eat and sleep peacefully. I can't forgive myself, and hence it becomes even more painful.;;;;;;;;
1618;(Nisekoi);Claude;To us, you are more valuable than any jewel. Would you be at ease if you left your most treasured valuable outside the bounds of your own home? A treasure is something you keep with you at all times. It is common sense.;;;;;;;;
1619;(Psycho Love Comedy);Hikawa Renko;Don't start thinking of killing just when the slightest thing doesn't go your way! How selfish are you!?;;;;;;;;
1620;(Sugar Dark);Crow;Now it’s not just your heart, but also your breathing, your brain, your nervous system, and everything else… See, the human body is in some way always moving from the time they were in their mother’s womb until the last moments of their life. Even when someone is asleep, fainted, or unconscious, their body never stops. In other words, the concept of stopping is precisely how humans are able to perceive death.;;;;;;;;
1621;(Kimi ni Todoke);Shouta Kazehaya;If you're at a loss for words, you don't have to force yourself. That in itself is a form of comfort.;;;;;;;;
1622;(Final Fantasy VIII);Squall Leonhart;Right and wrong are not what separate us and our enemies, it's our perspectives that separate us. Both sides blame one another. There's no good or bad side, just two sides holding different views.;;;;;;;;
1623;(Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children);Tifa Lockhart;Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking.;;;;;;;;
1624;(Final Fantasy IX);Vivi Ornitier;How do you prove that you exist...? Maybe we don't exist.;;;;;;;;
1625;(Final Fantasy VIII);Squall Leonhart;Why do people depend on each other? In the end you're on your own.;;;;;;;;
1626;(Final Fantasy XIII);Éclair Farron;It's not a question of can or can't. There are some things in life you just do.;;;;;;;;
1627;(Final Fantasy XIII);Oerba Dia Vanille;Maybe we'd fall short. Maybe we'd never even come close. But someone, someday would know we've tried.;;;;;;;;
1628;(Freedom Wars);Aries M;Regret... It's a heavy burden. You can't help wondering if maybe you chose the wrong path. Because once you've chosen, you can't change your mind.;;;;;;;;
1629;(Final Fantasy XV);Noctis Lucis Caelum;Fools set the rules in this world. Just take a look around. It's undeniable.;;;;;;;;
1630;(Nanatsu no Taizai);Helbram;It's troublesome if the villain doesn't show their evil. Villains are necessary to make knights into heroes.;;;;;;;;
1631;(Inu X Boku SS);Joutarou Kawasumi;People become themselves through their encounters. With different things, people, and emotions.;;;;;;;;
1632;(Vandread);Rabat;Compared to one million proverbs, just one word from your heart can prove victorious!;;;;;;;;
1633;(R-15);Suiboku Kuroki;Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration! In other words, believe in your inspiration and fight to the end! Perspiration without inspiration is worthless! No matter what others say ignore them! Trust your talent! Follow your own path!;;;;;;;;
1634;(Tales from Earthsea);Root;In ages past, dragons and men were one. Those who lusted after wealth chose the land and the sea and became men. Those who cherished freedom, became dragons and chose wind and fire.;;;;;;;;
1635;(Trigun: Badlands Rumble);Gasback;Instead of picking fruit when it's green, you should wait, wait, and wait until it ripens. When they reach their peak, you pick them off! Even though the action itself is the same, they taste totally different.;;;;;;;;
1636;(Brave 10);Anastasia;Do you think you're the main character of some kind of sob story? You don't want to see people get hurt, so you cover your eyes and ears. Using your grief to hide the suffering is the easiest path to take. But I won't forgive you if you do. You're a Brave aren't you? Do you intend to live as someone who's always protected by others!? Fight! What will you solve by running away? The ability to keep going forward is strength as well! Physical strength is not all there is to it!;;;;;;;;
1637;(Loveless);Agatsuma Soubi;I hate butterflies. I hate them for being pretty. I hate them for being easy to catch. And having pins stuck through their body and being turned into specimens is what I hate most.;;;;;;;;
1638;(Kuroko No Basket);Midorima Shintarou;The only lucky item you'll need is already within - CONFIDENCE.;;;;;;;;
1639;(Bungaku Shoujo);Kanako Sakurai;I believe being an author is a lonely line of work that asks you to pass through a narrow gate alone.;;;;;;;;
1640;(Doraemon);Nobita Nobi;You’ll stumble many times in the future, but when you do, each time you’ll have more strength to bounce back.;;;;;;;;
1641;(Sakura Taisen);Shinguji Sakura;Destiny is what you create with your own will.;;;;;;;;
1642;(.hack//GIFT);Silver Knight;Those who stand above others, must have noble ideals along with the most noble intentions. Anyone that cannot manage the will of the masses is not fit to serve as the leader. You say you're punishing someone for standing up to you? That kind of justice is a lie.;;;;;;;;
1643;(Dusk maiden of Amnesia);Kirie Kanoe;Saying that people's personalities are products of their pasts isn't totally wrong. The way people live depends on their experiences.;;;;;;;;
1644;(Major);Major;At first, people only play as dots. But when lines of trust and friendship connect those dots, the lines become a circle and that circle is teamwork. As long as you keep playing as a dot, the others won't trust you either.;;;;;;;;
1645;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Shinichi Izumi;You shouldn't mouth off when you don't know shit.;;;;;;;;
1646;(Shinmai Maou no Testament);Basara Tōjō;There are some scars that never fade.;;;;;;;;
1647;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Shinichi Izumi;If talking won't resolve matters, maybe inflicting some pain will.;;;;;;;;
1648;(Jing: King of Bandits);Jing;Shining brightly even for a split second is better than living a dull-grey life for eternity.;;;;;;;;
1649;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;People have many different ways of thinking. Even if you make a mistake, if you realize it was a mistake, You can always fix it. Then if you turn around, you will see the future. This must be realized by oneself.;;;;;;;;
1650;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Yuyuka Nekota;At times like these, you shouldn't depend on people's advice, but think about it thoroughly by yourself and make a decision. Because there's no right answer when it comes to love. Whatever your answer is, if it's your own choice, then it's right.;;;;;;;;
1651;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Satsuki Shishio;Don't judge me if you don't stand in my position.;;;;;;;;
1652;(Chihayafuru 2);Chihayafuru 2;Charm is reserved for dealing with people with more power than you.;;;;;;;;
1653;(Kuroshitsuji);Elizabeth Midford;Weak in order to love, strong in order to protect, both in order to stay at your side. ;;;;;;;;
1654;(Free! Eternal Summer);Rei Ryugazaki;Being free can mean many different things, but I think it's truest meaning is having a free heart that can't be bound by anything. So no matter what choice you make, as long as you remain who you are, you will forever be free.;;;;;;;;
1655;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;If I die here, then I'm a man that could only make it this far.;;;;;;;;
1656;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Hiroko Seto;It's not just allies who support each other. From your enemies, you learn so much and gain so much. Until the day you meet again... Just knowing they exist helps you to withstand the loneliness. Those who compete, even if they're enemies, help each other out.;;;;;;;;
1657;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;We are searching for a place where we can live our lives in peaceful days. No wars, no stealing;;;;;;;;
1658;(Trigun);Rem Saverem;If you keep your vision clear you will see the future. What happens in our future is our own responsibility.;;;;;;;;
1659;(Kingdom Hearts);Sora;Although my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grom with each new experience. And it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made. I’ve become a part of their heart, just as they’ve become part of mine. And if they think of me now and then, if they don’t forget me, then our hearts will be one. I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!;;;;;;;;
1660;(Deadman Wonderland);Ganta Igarashi;Facing irrationality doesn't mean not feeling fear, but rather possessing eyes that gaze upon fear and standing against the world.;;;;;;;;
1661;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Daiki Mamura;How will you live if every little thing from your memories always hurts you easily?;;;;;;;;
1662;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Yuyuka Nekota;"""My heart controls the world."" But who can I control if I'm the only one living in this world?";;;;;;;;
1663;(Noir);Odette Bouquet;To be sure, love can kill, but always remember, hate can never save. Never!;;;;;;;;
1664;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Fear. That is what we live with. And we live it everyday. Only in death are we free of it.;;;;;;;;
1665;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Daiki Mamura;The most annoying thing is that I can't do anything for you, even though you're crying.;;;;;;;;
1666;(The World God Only Knows);Haqua du Lot Herminium;Human hearts are complicated mysteries.;;;;;;;;
1667;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;Books are information. And information that isn't correct is worthless.;;;;;;;;
1668;(Log Horizon);Mizufa Trudy;The strong use their strength as their weapon. The weak use their weakness as their weapon.;;;;;;;;
1669;(Berserk);Griffith;I feel no responsibility to comrades who've lost lives under my command. Because they chose to fight in each battle.. Just as I chose this. But if there is something that... I can do for them. Something I can do for the dead... Then it is to win! I must keep winning to attain my dream. The same one they clung to, and risked their lives for!! To realize my dream, I will perch on top of their corpses.. It is a blood-smeared dream, after all. I don't regret or feel guilty about it.. But to risk thousands of lives while never getting myself dirty. It's not a dream that can be so easily realized! ;;;;;;;;
1670;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Yuyuka Nekota;Thinking about whether it's because of jealousy or just saying it out loud by accident, aren't they all part of love? Love isn't always sweet.;;;;;;;;
1671;(Chihayafuru 2);Hidehiro Harada;Luck of the draw isn’t about luck. Luck doesn’t decide a match!;;;;;;;;
1672;(Death Note);Light Yagami;Humans aren't made perfectly. Everyone lies. Even so... I've been careful not to tell lies that hurt others.;;;;;;;;
1673;(Gintama);Shimura Tae;Some lies are necessary for giving children dreams.;;;;;;;;

1677;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Even the strongest of opponents always has a weakness.;;;;;;;;
1678;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;I know the loneliness of being a prisoner. I know the joy you feel when your friends come to rescue you and the fear of them being injured and defeated.;;;;;;;;
1679;(Kuroko No Basket);Akashi Seijuurou;I do not allow anyone acting against me to look down upon me.;;;;;;;;
1680;(Kuroshitsuji);Elizabeth Midford;Poetry over philosophy. Embroidery rather than cooking. Dance instead of chess. Be an unknowing angel. Every girl born in the country of roses is raised by these three words. ;;;;;;;;
1681;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Yuyuka Nekota;I'm the one who selfishly decides who's my friend and who's not.;;;;;;;;
1682;(Loveless);Aoyagi Ritsuka;People who use others are stupid, but people who are used are even more stupid.;;;;;;;;
1683;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Have faith in your inspiration. Feel the imagination!;;;;;;;;
1684;(Chihayafuru 2);Yuusei Nishida;You can’t stop fighting to play. Once you've lost that drive, you’ll start to lose your edge.;;;;;;;;
1685;(Chihayafuru 2);Hidehiro Harada;That’s something you can’t know until you've tried it, and you still won’t understand after you play. I've been playing for 45 years and I still don’t understand. I've never been able to figure it out. That’s why I keep playing.;;;;;;;;
1686;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;Clouds... come here. Drops... fall here. Drive out the flames... tell him... that despite all of this... the world is still beautiful.;;;;;;;;

1688;(Shaman King);Anna Kyouyama;Humans only can reveal their true potential during an absolutely critical situation.;;;;;;;;
1689;(Ao Haru Ride);Yuuri Makita;Different people have different perspective. So, I won’t deny the fact that some people are annoyed with the way I am. In exchange for those negative feelings, I just want to be the person that I am in love with the most.;;;;;;;;
1690;(Fairy Tail TV 2/2014);Zeref;Over the course of several hundred years, I've seen many ages end, conflict between people, hatred, wicked hearts. I always have hope that the new age will purify all of that. How many times has it happened? People repeat themselves. They commit the same mistakes, over and over.... They haven't survived, not in true sense. The precious race called people has become extinct.;;;;;;;;
1691;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;Girls are more fragile than you think. They can be hurt by the smallest things.;;;;;;;;
1692;(Fruits Basket);Ritsu Sohma;I’m a complete failure. At everything I do, I’m absolutely worthless. I know this, and yet I continue to burden the human race with my presence. Every day I rob the world of valuable air by breathing. I’m a thief, and I hate myself for it. I don’t deserve to exist. But even though I know it’s the right thing to do, I’m such a useless coward. I don’t even have the courage to jump!;;;;;;;;
1693;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;I'm not afraid of the times I can't see him. When I feel pain in my chest, my song grows... The scenery feels closer. The next time I see you... I will, once again, fall in love.;;;;;;;;

1695;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Hirunaka no Ryuusei;The fun things, the painful things, the things that happened, the things we've cried about, the things we've smiled about, when we remember them, everything will be glittering.;;;;;;;;
1696;(Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei);Ryuuguu Rena;Even if you lovingly collect every last piece of a shattered cup, pieces are still pieces. Once something breaks, it can never return.;;;;;;;;
1697;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Mikoto Misaka;What you learn at your school is more important than where you go to school.;;;;;;;;

1704;(Kamisama Hajimemashita);Yatori;They say that ill weeds grow apace, but... You know, the nice ones don't live long.;;;;;;;;
1705;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Whether I go or not, I'll die anyway. I have an organ more important than my heart. Although you can't see it, I feel it going through my head down to my feet, and I know it exists within me. It lets me stand on my feet, it lets me walk forward without trembling. If I stop here, I feel like it would break... My soul will break.;;;;;;;;
1706;(Kuroko's Basketball);Atsushi Murasakibara;All these things you guys seek....hard work, guts, faith....I'll crush them all.;;;;;;;;
1707;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;I was too bent on fulfilling my objectives… I failed to see things from a larger perspective. I failed to build up a good relationship with them.;;;;;;;;
1708;(Princess Lover!);Arima Teppei;The more material you possess, the harder you'll feel the loss.;;;;;;;;
1709;(Naruto Shippūden);Naruto Uzumaki;There is no telling what kind of pain will come  after me, but... if I stop believing because of that, if the hero should change, it'll turn into another story from the one my master left behind. Then it wont be Naruto! I can't write novels like my master did. That's why the sequel has to come from the life I live no matter how great the pain, I'll continue walking because that's who Naruto is!;;;;;;;;
1710;(Serial Experiments Lain);Lain Iwakura;People only have substance within the memories of other people. And that's why there were all kinds of mes. There weren't a lot of mes per se, I was just inside all sorts of people, that's all.;;;;;;;;
1711;(Akatsuki no Yona);Gi-gan;Sometimes we women must fight too, don't underestimate us!;;;;;;;;
1712;(Pochama ni);Tsumugi Motohashi;When I was little, I was teased because of my weight. I tried dieting, but diets always failed. Little by little I started feeling gloomy. I got to the point where I couldn't make friends, and I started hating myself more and more. I became completely unable to smile. I thought, no one in the world would ever like me the way I am now. But at the same time I also thought, if that's the way it is, then I should at least like myself.;;;;;;;;
1713;(Monster);Kenzo Tenma;I was only able to get back to being a real doctor by saving your life! I realized that human lives have equal value by saving you! Nobody has the right to take another's life! I've been living as a doctor with that engraved upon my heart for years!;;;;;;;;
1714;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;No one really starts out kind. All we know how to do at first is want. We want food, we want attention... It's just natural survival instinct, I guess... But kindness is something that we all have to learn as we go. It's something that grows and develops slowly over time... The same way our bodies do...;;;;;;;;
1715;(Chihayafuru 2);Sumire Hanano;Humans have always spent a lot of time on love. I’m not too interested in karuta, but I’m willing to work hard for love.;;;;;;;;
1716;(Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season);Inaho Kaizuka;Right, It's too late for doubts now. There is no returning from this place I've come to.;;;;;;;;
1717;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;The rain, the wind, the sun... you bring them all with you. Every time our eyes meet. You bring the world to me.;;;;;;;;
1718;(Gintama);Katsura Kotarou;If you have faith, your dreams will surely come true.;;;;;;;;
1719;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Yuyuka Nekota;You wouldn't get an answer no matter how much you think about it. Love is not Japanese nor Math. It doesn't need thoughts of reasons. You will be aware of it when that person is next to you.;;;;;;;;
1720;(Trigun);Chapel the Evergreen;Life is an incessant series of problems... all difficult, with brutally limited choices... and a time limit.;;;;;;;;
1721;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Tamura Reiko;I've been thinking... for a long while. For what purpose was I born into this world? Whenever I resolved one question, another would arise in its place. I sought the beginning. I sought the end. I've just been walking and walking, thinking all the while. Perhaps nothing will change, no matter how far I go. If I'm to stop my journey, that is fine, too. Even if I were informed that everything has reached its end, I'd just accept it. But even so, I found an answer to yet another of my questions today.;;;;;;;;
1722;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;If you lose something big, that nothing can replace it... Then it’s okay if you have more than one, right? Even if the number is small, whether it’s 10 or 100, if you gather them up then you will have a reason to go on!;;;;;;;;
1723;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Even if you're a main character, you can still die... I better be careful-ttebayo. ;;;;;;;;
1724;(Ao Haru Ride);Shuuko Murao;The feeling of not wanting to lose, everyone has it. If you find it unfair, you’ll have to work harder yourself.;;;;;;;;
1725;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Sonozaki Mion;No one can say they grew up in a sterile room, never failing or making mistakes. Life is an ongoing process of trial and error.;;;;;;;;
1726;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;"I've no interest in a ""Reality"".";;;;;;;;
1727;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Daiki Mamura;Even if I'm an outsider, even if I'm hers for only a moment, I wanted to become someone special to her. Just by being together with me, just for a little while, I wanted her to be happy.;;;;;;;;
1728;(Ao Haru Ride);Kou Mabuchi;We can no longer go back though, I’m totally different from that person in the past, you too. That was just a brief reminiscing of our past, that’s all.;;;;;;;;
1729;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;"The ""tsun"" personality is an armor that protects purity. An iron virgin.";;;;;;;;
1730;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;You're like a cat. If I get close, you'll ignore me and go far away. If I get hurt, you'll play around to share the pain.;;;;;;;;
1731;(Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei);Ryuuguu Rena;There's only one world for us, and things in it are set up so that we can find happiness in it. ;;;;;;;;

1734;(The World God Only Knows);Keima Katsuragi;Yes, I have no reason to take part in the Absurd and Unreasonable real world.;;;;;;;;
1735;(Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei);Ryuuguu Rena;A flower raised in a greenhouse is still beautiful, even though it knows no adversity. But a flower growing in the field that has braved wind, rain, cold, and heat possesses something more than just beauty. ;;;;;;;;
1736;(Nabari no Ou);Durandal Tobari Kumohira;Because it has powers that surpass everything, a king must cut off his own desires and never use it.;;;;;;;;
1737;(Kamisama No Memochou);Kamisama No Memochou;Songs are great. They reach people no matter how far they are. Even to people dear to you, who are no longer here.;;;;;;;;
1738;(Durarara!!×2);Izaya Orihara;To enjoy an ordinary life, you must constantly evolve. ;;;;;;;;
1739;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;They come without asking, and then they leave just the same. But once you meet them, even if nobody ever knows it, that encounter will change your life for the better.  ;;;;;;;;
1740;(Death Parade);Decim;I do not think humans are foolish. I have respect for people who live fulfilled lives. ;;;;;;;;
1741;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;Whether we move forward or stop, we're going in different directions little by little.;;;;;;;;
1742;(Junjō Romantica);You Miyagi;I don't believe in destiny. I always thought that it was nothing more than an overlap of coincidences. But if a meeting changes from chance to inevitable, that's what we call destiny.;;;;;;;;
1743;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;Sometimes I think delinquents are people… Who still have hope that things still can get better if they just put up a SOS sign. But I don’t even have the will to lift that sign anymore.;;;;;;;;
1744;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ryūichirō Isaka;There are some people who possess certain things that money cannot buy... as if it as as natural as breathing...;;;;;;;;
1745;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;I don’t know what you’re aiming at, but you can’t expect to be perfect right off the bat. You have to build up your confidence… by achieving small tasks one by one.;;;;;;;;
1746;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;If I give my best and am told that I’m useless, then that’s my own fault. But being considered useless, without having even tried, is something I can’t allow.;;;;;;;;
1747;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;You're not the first person I went out with... But you're my first love.;;;;;;;;
1748;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Shōta Kisa;Love in real life isn’t as smooth as in manga... ;;;;;;;;
1749;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;When I’m shown something so pure and innocent, I’m forced to see the filthy part of myself even more and it pisses me off.;;;;;;;;
1750;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;Since then… I’ve started to think…about things with the worst case outcome first. By doing so, even if you did get hurt a little bit, it wouldn’t end up being a lasting wound.;;;;;;;;
1751;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Shōta Kisa;My problem is probably that I don’t have any confidence about anything I do. Even if the thing I want most is right in front of me, I can’t help but imagine a future where I’m being rejected by it. I’m scared of getting hurt, so I run away from the people I love. What a good-for-nothing loser.;;;;;;;;
1752;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve met you before, but I can’t remember where.;;;;;;;;
1753;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Shōta Kisa;Why do I always do this? I fall in love with someone, then I get all these and then I feel brokenhearted. And It's always my fault.;;;;;;;;
1754;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;God, my face hurts from forcing smiles all night...;;;;;;;;
1755;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;I knew that it was pointless to hope for anything. I was so apathetic because of this sort of upbringing.;;;;;;;;
1756;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;If you don't feel anything for me, just leave me alone. I don't want your tepid kindness.;;;;;;;;
1757;(Princess Princess);Tooru Kouno;"When things change, isn't it better to get used to the new situation quickly? If that's the case, it's better to know what you have to do. Rejecting everything and doing things half-heartedly won't make it any easier. Hanging onto your pride will only weigh you down. So, to make life easier, sometimes it's best to go along with what other people want. As I said, it's just like the old saying: ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"". Instead of others forcing it upon you, it's easier for you to want to do it yourself, right? You should try it, Mikoto. You'll be happier.";;;;;;;;
1758;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;When you said that we were scary, that means deep down, you had started to care about us! The thought of losing someone again… That’s the scary part, right?;;;;;;;;
1759;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Tamura Reiko;"You all underestimate humans. Individually, they may appear weak, but that is not the case. What we need to recognize is that humans are a single life-form comprised of millions of individuals. Besides their individual brains, humans possess a different ""brain"" of enormous magnitude. The moment we act in opposition to that brain, we will lose.";;;;;;;;
1760;(Soul Eater);Marie Mjolnir;An apple a day keeps any one away, if you throw it hard enough!;;;;;;;;
1761;(Akatsuki no Yona);Zeno;People are mirrors. If you smile, a smile will be reflected.;;;;;;;;
1762;(Mirai Nikki);Amano Yukiteru;I'm pathetic. I was observing the world from a safe distance. I was just scared of being hurt. I was lonely.;;;;;;;;
1763;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;You own the world, but you've never looked at any of it. What a waste. ;;;;;;;;
1764;(Gakuen Alice);Mikan Sakura;To me, death is not the scariest thing at all.;;;;;;;;
1765;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;We’re searching for a reason of existence. With our own strength, because maybe the truth is that there’s no reason for life from the very beginning. Everyone hopes and tries so hard to find a reason of existence. The reason of birth, of staying with someone, of existence, believing we have to find them all with our own hands. Like finding a place for ourselves in dreams, in jobs, in people. The reasons we conclude may be indefinite and fragile. We may lose it too, but even so, we want a reason. As long as I’m alive, I want it too. If possible, I want to find a reason of existence within a person, within someone.;;;;;;;;
1766;(Fruits Basket);Megumi Hanajima;There are things that take a long time to acquire. Friends. Love. Really, nothing has been a waste.;;;;;;;;
1767;(Chihayafuru 2);Sumire Hanano;I won’t accept it! I want to have a choice, too! I don’t want to write poems about regret.;;;;;;;;
1768;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Iraha Lemercier;Destiny is a mysterious thing. It lets people reach their intended destinations.;;;;;;;;
1769;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;Any harm that comes to me because of you is harm that I need. I want to share your pain. So I want you to let me fight. With you.;;;;;;;;
1770;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Livius Orvinus Ifrikia;The world just exists to hurt people and to be conquered. To survive, you mow down your enemies and take what you want.;;;;;;;;
1771;(Gakuen Alice);Izumi Yukihira;You always seem to look back. The scenery in front of you, the people near you, don't you see it? Live right now. That's what life is.;;;;;;;;
1772;(Gakuen Alice);Yuu Tobita;There will be some who give up because they are dissatisfied... But some feel unsettled and are lonely. So if... one day we could all laugh freely together... We, who are all in the same circumstances, can help each other... I think that will be more comforting than anything else and will also chase away loneliness.;;;;;;;;
1773;(Gakuen Alice);Mikan Sakura;Work together with everyone, motivating one another...even though they may not be your close friends, you can still understand each another. I'm looking forward to bonding with more people.;;;;;;;;
1774;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;Will you stay by my side? Will you watch as we uncover a harsh truth that was meant to remain buried, and share in the pain that comes with the act?;;;;;;;;
1775;(07 Ghost);Teito Klein;I used to think that eating was only consuming needed nutrients. I never thought it could fill the emptiness in me.;;;;;;;;
1776;(Uta no Prince-sama);Haruka Nanami;A light comes out of the darkness. A heart that makes a flower bloom in the wilderness journeys through the sky. Music changes the world.;;;;;;;;
1777;(Chihayafuru 2);Taichi Mashima;I know that I'm not alone, but I want to be strong even when I am.;;;;;;;;
1778;(Chihayafuru 2);Kanade Ōe;It’s vulgar and foolish to spend all your time thinking about love!;;;;;;;;
1779;(Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica);Tatara Phoron;Humans and spirits. We're indeed different beings, but that is why understanding each other is meaningful.;;;;;;;;
1780;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Livius Orvinus Ifrikia;I don't need some ring or some throne! If it means that I won't lose you... I would throw everything away!;;;;;;;;
1781;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;What you need are feelings and experiences. The feelings of the person seeking the rain must be in concert with those of the person making it.;;;;;;;;
1782;(Gakuen Alice);Natsume Hyuuga;Don't bother coming to the darkness that you don't need to see... I don't want to show you the darkness that doesn't belong to you... Don't let yourself be hurt so much anymore... Rather, let me be your strength.;;;;;;;;
1783;(Gakuen Alice);Amane Rui;Crying over ill luck won't do you any good. You must believe tomorrow will be better than today and smile.;;;;;;;;
1784;(Uta no Prince-sama);Haruka Nanami;Songs move people's hearts and make them passionate.;;;;;;;;
1785;(Uta no Prince-sama);Kurusu Syo;Those who aren't geniuses only have effort. All you can do is use effort to compensate for a deficiency of talent.;;;;;;;;
1786;(Liar Game);Artier;The society you all live in has long since turned into the Liar Game. Still, what all of you demonstrated through this game is that 'Believing' is by no means, an easy path to follow. Sometimes, taking it means allowing yourself be deceived or suffering heavy damage you will not ever recover from. And yet, 'Trust' born when you forget your personal interests and join forces to fight against the odds together holds tremendous power.;;;;;;;;
1787;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;Don't succumb to panic. Only those who see the bigger picture win.;;;;;;;;
1788;(Liar Game);Yokoya Norihiko;The question is what does it take to be the one in control? Money? Brains? Strategic Prowess? Of course, all three are very important. However, there is something that outshines them all and provides a faster and more effective way to victory. And that is... information. The one in possession of information will be able to easily become the ruler of the liar game.;;;;;;;;
1789;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;A former teacher of mine, Okabe-sensei, was always saying this to me: 'To believe people is to doubt them.'... meaning if you keep doubting people and searching what's inside them, sooner or later you're bound to understand something about them. And when you do, you'll be able to entrust something to them. That is what it means to trust and believe.;;;;;;;;
1790;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;Accident or amnesia, you can't rewind your life and start again. If you struggle, you'll just hurt yourself, and the people around you.;;;;;;;;
1791;(Haikyuu!!);Shōyō Hinata;Do you need a reason to not want to lose?;;;;;;;;
1792;(Nabari no Ou);Shijima Kurookano;The most precious thing is different for every human. They resist and kill each other because of their difference. It has nothing to do with the inability to sense the other's most important thing.;;;;;;;;
1793;(Inu X Boku SS);Inu X Boku SS;It is a tasteless life if you don't have something you regret.;;;;;;;;
1794;(Uta no Prince-sama);Ichinose Hayato;Maybe everything you wish for won't become stars, but if you have a dream to believe in, they'll be thousands of the most glittering jewels in the night sky.;;;;;;;;
1795;(Uta no Prince-sama);Shining Saotome;The beating of a heart is the first source of music!;;;;;;;;
1796;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;If we love someone, we need to tell them about it. That way, we'll feel relieved and a lot stronger.;;;;;;;;
1797;(Chihayafuru 2);Chihaya Ayase;I never knew until the first years came, that we all cared about different things.;;;;;;;;
1798;(Chihayafuru 2);Tsutomu Komano;I’ve been in your shoes. I was also given a chance. There’s no rush. You’ll get better very soon.;;;;;;;;
1799;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;There were many tears, many unsure times, and many troubled moments. The fun memories were only a few, but even so, those memories will shine bright like stardust and continue to shine on in my heart.;;;;;;;;
1800;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Satsuki Shishio;I knew this was a losing battle. Even though the outcome was obvious, I still wanted to bet on that one millimeter of a possibility.;;;;;;;;
1801;(Akatsuki no Yona);Yona;I always wanted to become stronger. At first it was to protect myself. Next, it was to protect Hak, who gave up everything for me. Now, it's to repay my friends, who enabled me to live.;;;;;;;;
1802;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Chizuru Ooshima;I'm always just waiting. Waiting for someone to reach out to me. But at the same time, I'm really self-conscious and a coward.;;;;;;;;
1803;(Black Lagoon);Balalaika;Justice. I can't think of another word more loved by the people. It does have a nice ring to it. However, without ever exercising your own strength, you seek the death of others at the hands of someone else. Well, the justice you refer to smells pretty rotten to me.;;;;;;;;
1804;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;To turn someone down and to be turned down by someone... To be hurt by someone and to hurt someone... A love where no one gets hurt doesn't exist.;;;;;;;;
1805;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;Even though I'm expressionless, being told that I'm annoying still hurts.;;;;;;;;
1806;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Shuntarou Chishiya;In this world with only despair, how do you live?;;;;;;;;
1807;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Suzume Yosano;Our minds don't work the way we expect them to.;;;;;;;;
1808;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Daiki Mamura;Honestly, someone who asks someone else to convey their feelings for them is the worst.;;;;;;;;
1809;(Hirunaka no Ryuusei);Daiki Mamura;If I'd known that the end would come so fast, I would have said so much more.;;;;;;;;
1810;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;Does it really matter that people don't like you?;;;;;;;;
1811;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;"If you become perplexed or make errors, in the end have the kind of life that you can have pride in living. The kind where you can say, ""I persevered."" Repeating delightful things and sad things. And in that way keep getting older. I persevered.";;;;;;;;
1812;(Monster);Kenzo Tenma;Even if you can forget, you can't erase the past.;;;;;;;;
1813;(Monster);Johann Liebert;Hatred is born when people gather together.;;;;;;;;
1814;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;I'm not sure why I've decided to do this. I'm not any stronger than I was, and nothing else has changed. But all the same, this time I'm not going to run away. It's okay to feel weak sometimes. It's okay to be afraid. The important thing is that we face our fears. That's... that's what makes us strong.;;;;;;;;
1815;(Black Butler: Book of Circus);Sebastian Michaelis;The hungrier one is, the more satisfying one's dinner.;;;;;;;;
1816;(Nabari no Ou);Yoite;If it's a wish that can be fulfilled, then fulfill it. If there's hesitation and worries, then remove the sources of worries altogether.;;;;;;;;
1817;(Uragiri Wa Boku No Namae Wo Shitteiru);Luka Crosszeria;An illusion is darkness. Those who cannot see the darkness cannot resist its sweet temptation and are stained black. Eventually the darkness envelops the light controlling everything. ;;;;;;;;
1818;(Deadman Wonderland);Madoka Shishito;Human beings don't feel pain with their bodies. The brain is the thing that transmits the pain to the body.;;;;;;;;
1819;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Saori Shibuki;With death staring you in the face, you truly understand what it means to be alive.;;;;;;;;
1820;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;To leave the first tracks, we must go somewhere nobody's been yet.;;;;;;;;
1821;(Nerawareta Gakuen);Saitō-sensei;Phones, the internet - having the means alone doesn't lead to communication.;;;;;;;;
1822;(Nerawareta Gakuen);Jinno Yuu;I wonder if our hearts really do determine our feelings. Or are they just some sort of aroma in the air?;;;;;;;;
1823;(Nerawareta Gakuen);Jinno Yuu;What about when you reciprocate someone else’s emotions? Is that still coming from you… or is the air connecting you to one another?;;;;;;;;
1824;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;Why are you looking for something when you can't even remember what it is?;;;;;;;;
1825;(Nerawareta Gakuen);Seki Kenji;There’s no such thing as a person who doesn’t belong. You’re here because there’s someone who wants you to be here.;;;;;;;;
1826;(Nerawareta Gakuen);Suzuura Natsuki;Embrace that feeling. Love’s never rational.;;;;;;;;
1827;(Living for the Day After Tomorrow);Tadashi Isogai;Romance is just trying to convey your feelings to another person.;;;;;;;;
1828;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;It would be cruelest to keep your hopes up when I already know the answer.;;;;;;;;
1829;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Natsume Asako;There's nothing more repulsive than being touched by a guy you don't like.;;;;;;;;
1830;(Akatsuki no Yona);Yun;Inability to overcome fear is human.;;;;;;;;
1831;(Tokyo Ghoul √A);Juuzou Suzuya;Whether we die or not, isn't really that big a deal.;;;;;;;;
1832;(Akatsuki no Yona);Yun;Prodigies don't understand how the incompetent feel.;;;;;;;;
1833;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Usagi Yuzuha;Life is built upon the taking of another life. If you have the resolve to kill, then you have the obligation to eat.;;;;;;;;
1834;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Saori Shibuki;When the guarantee of safety is dangled right in front of their eyes, humans will turn their eye from probability.;;;;;;;;
1835;(Imawa no Kuni no Alice);Shuntarou Chishiya;Whether it's on the other side of the planet, or right in front of one's eyes, as long as one is safe, it doesn't matter how many others die. Isn't that humanity?;;;;;;;;
1836;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Seto Kaiba;Games are not boring. Games purify our souls and leave room for new development that challenges the mind! They are the products of human wisdom!;;;;;;;;
1837;(Death Parade);Decim;Life really is a mysterious thing. Each and every life spins its own, totally separate tale, yet they become intricately entwined in each other. And no one knows how they will end up.;;;;;;;;
1838;(Akatsuki no Yona);Ik-su;There is strength in words... Sometimes, they become words of power. I thought that if I said I'm fine, then I really would be fine. But it's no use... It doesn't work.;;;;;;;;
1839;(Akatsuki no Yona);Su-won;A heaven that only watches has no meaning.;;;;;;;;
1840;(Akatsuki no Yona);Hak Son;Making a fuss won't fix anything.;;;;;;;;
1841;(Shōnen Hollywood - Holly Stage for 49);Tsuyoto Hiiragi;"Even if they were mistakes, all you have to do is keep walking down that mistaken path. Simply assume that nothing lies before you except mistaken paths. Just so you know, the ""right"" path can be surprisingly dull. There are times when it's right to take the mistaken path. The moment you decide a path is right, all of the paths behind it become right, regardless of what it originally was. ";;;;;;;;
1842;(Fruits Basket);Kazuma Sohma;You're afraid to face what you know you must. So instead... you run away. The air that you said was smothering you... you know that it can also heal you. But you refuse to let it. You refuse to let anyone see you for your true self. You're too afraid of what you might lose. You're running away because you're afraid to admit your feelings even to yourself.;;;;;;;;
1843;(One Piece);Jinbei;You can't bring back what you've lost, think about what you have now!;;;;;;;;
1844;(Deadman Wonderland);Madoka Shishito;"This is the law of conservation of mass. Somebody's ""happiness"" is somebody else's ""unhappiness"". That's why I tried to be a ""rubbish bin"" for those guys who played othello on my back using white and black thumbtacks. My crying and screaming meant something, 'cause they were laughing... But I was wrong. It doesn't make sense, does it? If I enjoy being unhappy, that ""happiness"" will make someone else ""unhappy""! ";;;;;;;;
1845;(Azumanga Daioh);Ayumu Kasuga;If you tell a bald man his head is useful in the dark, you'll get punched in the face. Santa Claus says such cruel things.;;;;;;;;
1846;(Mushishi);Adashino;People derive their happiness in a variety of ways, even though it might seem cruel.;;;;;;;;
1847;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lloyd Asplund;"I think that ""truth"" is something that is covered up most of the time.";;;;;;;;
1848;(Eyeshield 21);Gen Takekura;When a man bleeds freely for the sake of other people, it's only proper to pretend that you never saw it.;;;;;;;;
1849;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;I want to hear it again, yet I don't want to hear it again. I want to see her, yet I don't want to see her. What do you call this kind of feeling again?;;;;;;;;
1850;(Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica);Corticarte Apa Lagranges;There are times when people who are different cannot understand each other. Even if you think you understand the other person, you really don't. And what awaits in the end, usually, is despair.;;;;;;;;
1851;(Tokyo Ghoul);Rize Kamishiro;Whose fault is it that things ended up like this? Coincidence? An accident? Fate? There's no such thing as fate. It's simply a combination of one circumstance and the next. And who is it that creates those circumstances? Who is it? It's you.;;;;;;;;
1852;(Tokyo Ghoul);Yakumo Oomori;All suffering in the world is born from an individual's incompetence.;;;;;;;;
1853;(Magic Kaito);Kaito Kuroba;Everyone is the main character of their own life.;;;;;;;;
1854;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;As of this moment, you're my official assistant. Your arms, your legs, your eyes, your ears, your throat, your nails, your teeth, and your tongue. Even the last drop of your blood. They all belong to me now.;;;;;;;;
1855;(07 Ghost);Castor;There are many things in this world that can't be protected simply by thinking of them or praying for them. To protect our lambs from having their dreams stolen and fading into despair, we Bishops bear arms and fight.;;;;;;;;
1856;(07 Ghost);Frau;As long as you keep anything about me within you... Always, my heart will be with you.;;;;;;;;
1857;(Gakuen Alice);Kokoro Yome;Help can come from unexpected corners.;;;;;;;;
1858;(Fruits Basket);Saki Hanajima;To truly love someone, is to always put their feelings before your own... no matter what.;;;;;;;;
1859;(Shiki);Tomio Ookawa;In this world, there are crimes too depraved to ever be forgiven.;;;;;;;;
1860;(Blood-C);Dog;Evil doesn't always seep out. It's possible to hide it if you’re careful and skilled.;;;;;;;;
1861;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;It is pointless to question who someone really is. All you can do is believe and accept. Because the way you perceive someone is their true identity.;;;;;;;;
1862;(Fruits Basket);Kazuma Sohma;Just as no matter how hard you try to keep it away, despair will attack you again and again. In the same manner, hope will return to you. Again and again.;;;;;;;;
1863;(Hellsing);Alucard;God spares no salvation to those who would beg for it. Nor is he merciful to those who would beseech his benevolence. These petty requests are no invocation to god. They are your death.;;;;;;;;
1864;(Tokyo Ghoul);Yoshimura;We're always trying to justify our actions with ideals. But ideals cannot give grounds for killing another person. The act of taking a life will always be considered... evil.;;;;;;;;
1865;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;"When you get anxious about the future, it is better not to think about it. The more you think about it the more anxious you'll get. Of course it's important to think about what lies ahead, too, but if you only look at what's down the road, you'll get tangled by the ""laundry"" by your feet and fall, won't you? You see, it's also important to think about what you can do now. What you can do today, and if you keep washing things one at a time, you'll be done before you know it. Sometimes the anxiety will start to well up, but when it does... take a little break. Read a book, watch tv, or eat soumen with everyone.";;;;;;;;
1866;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Lan Fan;A king is no king without his people. But people without a king are lost as well!;;;;;;;;
1867;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Kazuki Kazami;If someone lives, they will surely die. That is the absolute rule of this world.;;;;;;;;
1868;(07 Ghost);Teito Klein;I've always lived in a world of deceit. And amidst the lies, I was able to find my true treasure.;;;;;;;;
1869;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Kazuki Kazami;There are always lazy people to deal with when you act as a group. Splitting into pairs and handling out jobs is more efficient.;;;;;;;;
1870;(No Game No Life);Sora;Because of our weakness, we trained our eyes, ears and the ability to think. Learning how to survive, that's our trait as humans! The human species can't use magic and can't even perceive it—but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it! We don't have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable—to predict the future...Rejoice! We are humans;;;;;;;;
1871;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Kazuki Kazami;"I believe that ""I could have done something"" is the most frustrating regret of them all.";;;;;;;;
1872;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;I don't think anyone is born with a reason to live. It's something you have to find for yourself.;;;;;;;;
1873;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Kazuki Kazami;"That makes four time. Listen. The more you say, ""I'm sorry"", the lesser it's worth.";;;;;;;;
1874;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;A life that lives without doing anything is the same as a slow death.;;;;;;;;
1875;(Death Note);Mikami Teru;In this world, there is only good and evil, that was the first universal truths I grasped from observing the world around me when I was a child. Every human being without exception ends up falling into one category or the other.;;;;;;;;
1876;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;I'd rather die with someone than let that person die before my eyes. More so if she's a girl like you.;;;;;;;;
1877;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;Those who win are not strong. It is those who lose and crawl back up who are strong.;;;;;;;;
1878;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;You see, the world will not change through naive talks.;;;;;;;;
1879;(Medaka Box Abnormal);Najimi Ajimu;God, just how long are they going to squabble over such pointless things? They are all the same in my eyes. Nothing but a bunch of trash. Light and Darkness. Good and Evil. Poison and Antidote. Winning and Losing. Strength and Weakness. Black and White. Success and Failure. Happiness or Sorrow... They're all the same after all. Why hasn't everyone realized this already...;;;;;;;;
1880;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;There was no reason for me to get attacked by you. And therefore, there was no reason to dodge.;;;;;;;;
1881;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;You think something like that would hurt, after all I've been through?;;;;;;;;
1882;(Juuou Mujin no Fafnir);Mononobe Yuu;I could give you baseless hope through empty encouragement, but you'd just make the same mistake again. You won't live long if you don't own up to your failures.;;;;;;;;
1883;(Aria the Animation);Alicia Florence;There are some people who are rich and stay in beautiful places but are still unhappy. There are some people who are poor, but happy. In the end, happiness or sadness, only the person can determine.;;;;;;;;
1884;(Assassination Classroom);Korosensei;Whether a fish lives in a clear stream or a water ditch, so long as it continues swimming forward, it will grow up beautifully.;;;;;;;;
1885;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Lichtendahl Tsery;People can only truly understand things that they've actually experienced.;;;;;;;;
1886;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;"This is something my master used to say. ""Kids who are too obedient and never think of themselves are the hardest to watch."" ";;;;;;;;
1887;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Makina Irisu;"When cats are near death, they leave their owner's side, right? I'm sure that's exactly how I feel. I want to disappear while they can think, ""What a noisy, stupid girl she was, I wonder if she's doing okay.""";;;;;;;;
1888;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;At that point in my life, I couldn't find any value in anything. I was a brat who may as well be dead.;;;;;;;;
1889;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;Sometimes living can be hard! But it's only because we're alive that we can make each other laugh, cry, and be happy!;;;;;;;;
1890;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;We humans can indeed lose again something we've lost already.;;;;;;;;
1891;(Shuffle!);Fuyou Kaede;I'm not asking you to love me. No, actually, please don't love me. But please let me be in love with you.;;;;;;;;
1892;(Berserk);Guts;People who perish in other’s battles are worms… If one can’t live their life the way they want, they might as well die.;;;;;;;;
1893;(Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season);Slaine Troyard;Most birds fly, but there are some species of flightless birds. I suspect that Princess Asseylum might say that she find it sad that they cannot fly even though they have wings. But their inability to fly does not trouble them in the least. On the contrary, perhaps the ones to be pitied are the birds who can fly, but kept in a cage.;;;;;;;;
1894;(The World Is Still Beautiful);Nike Lemercier;The sun may be wonderful but can you live on that alone? We all live because of the wind, the clouds, and the rain. They're not things you can throw out just because they're temporarily inconvenient, right?;;;;;;;;
1895;(Broken Blade);Broken Blade;There is nothing shameful about running away. Some things are just out of people's hands. If you think you're gonna die, just run.;;;;;;;;
1896;(Broken Blade);Zess;History books are rewritten with the changing of times. At any rate, classroom lectures are worlds apart from the battlefield.;;;;;;;;
1897;(Broken Blade);Baldr;It is far more difficult to capture an enemy than to kill them. Capturing a soldier involves three times the effort and three times the danger. If you wish to save the life of an enemy soldier, remember that you'll lose three of your own in the process.;;;;;;;;
1898;(Kamisama No Memochou);Narumi Fujishima;Broken promises, regardless of how horrid transform into rage that stinks to the ocean floor. Through those bonds, we're drawn together countless times.;;;;;;;;
1899;(Broken Blade);Borcuse;Fear deals a crippling blow to soldiers. Be it a single man or a million soldiers, it makes no difference. Man can deny neither hunger nor fear.;;;;;;;;
1900;(Shinigami no Ballad);Momo;It looks like you're wishing you had died instead of someone else, but... isn't it wrong to think that way? No one can take the place of another. Each person has his own destiny.;;;;;;;;
1901;(Bungaku Shoujo);Ryūto Sakurai;Have you ever imagined how it feels to be treated like you don't exist? You're right there, but you get treated like you're not. You're denied everything - every day your heart gets carved up and you experience disappointment again and again, but you have to smile anyway. Do you know how that feels?;;;;;;;;
1902;(Bokura ga Ita);Nanami Takahashi;One thing I'm especially good at is finding Yano, whenever or wherever he may be. Because he's the one I love.;;;;;;;;
1903;(Bokura ga Ita);Nanami Takahashi;No one actually knows what's best or what the future holds. Until you actually see the results, no one ever knows. So at the very least, why don't we rely on what we do know. Let's keep the feelings that we have right now precious. Even though it seems like our lives never change, they slowly do. And just like how we never notice... the changing of the seasons... the same goes for our hearts.;;;;;;;;

1908;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hakaze Kusaribe;What's wrong with wanting to keep the man you love out of harm's way?;;;;;;;;

1910;(RDG: Red Data Girl);Izumiko Suzuhara;It's not like we lost anything when there was nothing between us to start with. We could never really be equals. I've always been alone.;;;;;;;;
1911;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;Snowdrop. I also don't know what I'm looking for. What does the future hold? Will I be able to not forget what I have found?;;;;;;;;
1912;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hakaze Kusaribe;Even if he hates me, being able to die with the knowledge that the one I love will never forget me… there is no greater happiness a woman could desire.;;;;;;;;
1913;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;O anger, turn to heat, dry up my brains! This mad thirst for vengeance must be quenched… no matter how cruel and merciless I must become!;;;;;;;;
1914;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hakaze Kusaribe;To lose the woman you loved, not even being able to grieve… if not a tragedy, what is it?;;;;;;;;

1919;(Black Rock Shooter);Mato Kuroi;To me, nothing is painful. There is no such thing as anguish. Even if some things seem like they hurt, deep down, everyone is a nice person. We can understand each other, or so I thought;;;;;;;;

1927;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;I called his name again and again. And I learned that each time, nothing called back.

1931;(Natsuyuki Rendezvous);Atsushi Shimao;Without a body, I can't even cry. Why am I here? I can't go anywhere. I'm neither here nor there. Who am I here for? What am I here for?;;;;;;;;
1932;(School Rumble);Kenji Harima;Now, now, these things happen to everyone... EXCEPT ME!!!!! That's for making fun of my masterpiece! If there's one thing I hate, it's criticism!;;;;;;;;

1935;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;This frustrating happiness... Days so warm it almost makes you dizzy. By this time next year... It may be time for me to stop looking away and know for real.

1939;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;It's strange isn't it. The two groups, which looked like they hated each other, are now shining the same color as they vanish into the distant sky.;;;;;;;;
1940;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;There are still times when our different ways of thinking make me hesitate but I feel like there are ways we can balance each other because we're different.;;;;;;;;
1941;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;There are things you can't have no matter how much you want them. So it's easier to just forget them.;;;;;;;;
1942;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Kaname Tanuma;Don't lie if you don't have to.;;;;;;;;
1943;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;When I look at their kind smiles and thought that I was supposed to be there smiling too... I couldn't stop crying. It hurt so much that I wanted to forget.;;;;;;;;

1945;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;
1946;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yūgi Mutō;When we first met, you set my heart ablaze. When I see you, all I can do is gaze. Gaze at the beauty and wonder that is you. The constellation Gemini will make me think of me and you. You are my Yami and I am your Hikari. I love you, my Yami. Now and forever.;;;;;;;;

1959;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Damn. My eyes are naturally drawn in her direction. Is this the unibreastal law of gravitation? Leave it to Sir Isaac Newtit.;;;;;;;;
1960;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;I'm not rude... I just wasn't taught to politely pretend to be nice to people I can't stand.;;;;;;;;
1961;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;Colors and lies both get blacker as you add more. Add enough red, and it'll turn black too.;;;;;;;;
1962;(Shinmai Maou no Testament);Basara Tōjō;Even if it is a game... There are some things I just can't lose.;;;;;;;;
1963;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;At this point, no matter how I change, the things I've lost won't come back.;;;;;;;;

The light in which all journeys are taken is deceptive - not hopeful, but sorrowful. And the struggle never ends. Everywhere on the earth is fleeting life. We are blown by the wind. The words we write in the sand disappear and finally, when we are swallowed by the sea we do not hear the waves. The humblest of creatures must face these dreadful barriers. No-not barriers, but challenges rather...;;;;;;;;
2009;(Le Portrait de Petit Cossette);Cossette d'Auvergne;If someone were to drown in the seas for my sake, then I would be released from stone and return to life... to live once more. But if I were to return to life one day, which would give me the most important thing - I would then cry alone. I would cry longing for my stone.

2017;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;For some time researchers have understood that moderate stress has beneficial effects. It boosts the immune system for example. Stress motivates and prepares us for action. It compels our body to survive. However, routine psycho pass checks take away the stress from us. There are patients whose stress reaction is so numb, they can’t even recognize the basic stimulation of their senses. Once that happens, it’s a neurological downward spiral, they become like living corpses. Eventually their autonomic nervous system stops working and their vital functions shut down.;;;;;;;;

2028;(ef: a tale of memories);ef: a tale of memories;“Miracles don't exist in this world. All that exists are accidents, inevitabilities and the actions that one takes.” That’s Himura’s favorite phrase, isn’t it? But sometimes the outcome of your actions, which becomes inevitable, will overlap with accidents, and fulfill your dream unexpectedly. I don’t know if that can be called a miracle, but there’s one thing I’m certain about. Nothing will happen if you don’t wish for it.;;;;;;;;

We've left the oceans and climbed above the mountains. I'm flying. We've found the untouched realm of God. You have to look now, it's your only chance. Nothing is here yet, not even air or water to ruin. Soon the next man will follow to touch it, and another, and in all the rush, we may again destroy it. Maybe our killing comes from the madness of being confined. Please listen, there's no more reason to kill because we don't have any more borders now! Can anyone hear me? If you can hear me, then pray. The humblest of all things, the most noble – pray for each step you take. Make a path that is safe so that those who follow you will never stumble. Dear God, please give us your mercy - mercy for we are lost. Forgive the irresponsible, the trivial men who beg you from the dark for the forgiveness of your light.;;;;;;;;
2052;(RahXephon);Haruka Shitow;The individual exists because there is a point of reference to identify itself.;;;;;;;;
2053;(NANA);Nana Komatsu;Even though it's painful sometimes, if you keep on living then good things can happen.;;;;;;;;
2054;(Again!!);Tatsuhiko Ookuma;It's okay to set your goals high;;;;;;;;
2055;(Fairy Tail);Ultear Milkovich;I always cursed my own life. The anxiety, anger and hatred I couldn't suppress. However, when I stopped to look at the sky... I realized just how small I am. There is an endless world spreading before me.;;;;;;;;
2056;(Samurai X: Trust & Betrayal);Seijuro Hiko;The moon pierced down on the diseased world. There is no cure for the disease. An entire race falls mindlessly into destruction. Not even a man of colossal power may be able to prevent the inevitable. Death no longer terrifies men. The smell of blood is as common as the smell of white plums, so he creates slavery and savagery which surpasses the horrors of dying. These can only be fought with more bloodshed and the cycle never ends. My sword is guided by the reasoning of Hiten Mitsurugi, but when all is said, a sword is a tool for destruction not salvation. The only way I can retain my humanity is to bury its victims.;;;;;;;;
2057;(Aldnoah.Zero);Cruhteo;When a dog soils the carpet, its master is responsible.;;;;;;;;
2058;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Yuuri Shibuya;I’m saying that love is not something that you’re only supposed to give to a single person and not another. Love is something you’re supposed to give equally to everyone.;;;;;;;;
2059;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Huh? What are you, retarded? I'm super thoughtful. That's why I stay in the corner and don't cause anyone trouble.;;;;;;;;
2060;(Sword Art Online II);Asuna Yūki;It's better not to look for more meaning than there is in a name. You'll lose sight of a lot more than you notice.;;;;;;;;
2061;(Sword Art Online II);Aki Natsuki;You did it because you had to protect someone else. In medicine, there are times when you must pick who lives and who dies. Of course, that doesn't mean it's okay to kill someone if you have a good reason. But everyone involved has the right to consider the lives they saved. You have the right. You have the right to save yourself, by thinking of the people you've saved.;;;;;;;;
2062;(The Comic Artist and His Assistants);Yuuki Aito;If you lose your uniqueness for fear of being disliked, then no one will ever love you.;;;;;;;;
2063;(Kantai Collection: KanColle);Akagi;Don't hesitate to tell the people you care about the feelings you have for them, because they may not be there tomorrow.;;;;;;;;
2064;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;You got in an accident. You couldn't do anything afterward. It's okay to feel ashamed about that. But don't run from that shame! You have to carry that humiliation with you and live on!;;;;;;;;
2065;(Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou);Rachnera Arachnera;I'm just letting you know, I'm not telling you this because I want your pity! I'm just fed up with humans, that's all! They tell lie after lie, only accepting people who are the same as they are! Humans are such hypocrites!;;;;;;;;
2066;(Kuroko No Basket);Kuroko No Basket;Human minds are not designed to accept negative statements like ‘don’t do this’ or ‘I can’t do that’, ‘we can’t make any mistakes’, ‘failure is not accepted’. These kinds of thoughts only serve to counter productively stress the body and lead to further mistakes. And if just one mistake is made, it turns into a vicious cycle. The more they think about it, the more mistakes will be made, and the more the quality of their plays will drop.;;;;;;;;
2067;(Kuroko No Basket);Tatsuya Himuro;What are you good at, what do you like… You need to show something that makes people understand who you are.;;;;;;;;
2068;(World Trigger);Yūma Kuga;(referring to his father) There are three lessons he taught me when I was six. Lesson one: Protect yourself, by yourself. Parents can't protect you forever. Work out or think hard and figure out a way to take care of things by yourself. Don't get close to things you can't take care of. Use your imagination to avoid danger. Lesson two: There's more than one answer. Things can be resolved in many ways. On the contrary, there's no answer in some cases. Don't get hung up with one way. And finally, lesson 3: Don't think your parents are always right.;;;;;;;;
2069;(Rozen Maiden);Shinku;This is what's inside your heart right now. A sky that has become this lovely, will not always remain sunny. There will be times when rain will fall and storms will carry on. The scenery will change, but if it is left alone, it will stay changed forever. For that, you must continue to fight, because that is to live. To live is to fight. ;;;;;;;;
2070;(Aldnoah.Zero);Inaho Kaizuka;Human beings aren't known for remaining calm and rational.;;;;;;;;
2071;(Rozen Maiden);Kirakishou;My heart is a cold cage where lies a person far more than my self, with an eye that can see the truth but reflects nothing, a cold stare from a distant person that use to know how to smile.;;;;;;;;
2072;(Record of Lodoss War);Record of Lodoss War;There once was a boy, who dreamed of being a hero, who sincerely believed in the battle to banish darkness from a world of light. But light and darkness are equals and where one exists, so too must the other. When the boy finally realized this, that was when he started the path to becoming a true hero.;;;;;;;;
2073;(Log Horizon);Shiroe;It's true that there's a lot we don't know about this world. But that's why we must go forward and do what we can. One thing at a time.;;;;;;;;
2074;(Zettai Shonen);Jirou Hatori;This world is far more complicated, rich and full of mystery, than people think.;;;;;;;;
2075;(Mushishi);Ginko;Just live normally. You'll be better off if you can catch some fish. Dig up the caves so you can set sail whenever you need to. It wouldn't be easy. But you have an endless amount of time ahead of you.;;;;;;;;
2076;(Gintama);Tama;It's true that your luster may not have been as bright as gold. You only shined on occasion. You were always arguing and fighting. You have wavy hair. You were lazy. You were the king of sexual harassment. You never paid the rent. You paid your people late. Still, you were brighter than the fake glint of gold plating. When you were angry, your entire soul was enraged. When you laughed, you laughed with all your heart. Your silver was much more beautiful.;;;;;;;;
2077;(Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan);Rikuo Nura;Immersed in ecstasy from killing weak things... A burdensome corpse with no benefit to people. Someone like that... I can't possibly forgive!;;;;;;;;
2078;(Yokai Rise Of The Nura Clan);Rikuo Nura;Light is radiant because there is darkness. And darkness is sublime because there is light.;;;;;;;;
2079;(Detective Conan);Jodie Starling;Relying on someone else without exerting any effort of your own is just not right. Because the one you rely on most, can disappear, at any time. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2081;(Durarara!!×2);Kasuka Heiwajima;I'm always being told that I don't understand other people's feelings, and also that I don't understand what others are thinking. And I agree. But... If you don't try to stem the tears of a girl crying out for help, you're the lowest kind of man.;;;;;;;;
2082;(Absolute Duo);Nagakura Imari;No matter what your power is, no matter how strong your opponent, lose once and it's over. That's the kind of world that's out there waiting for us. And once you lose, there's no do-overs.;;;;;;;;
2083;(Chuunibyo Demo Koi ga Shitai!);Makoto Isshiki;You don't need a reason to love someone.;;;;;;;;
2084;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;If I'm around you, I don't think I'll ever be bored.;;;;;;;;
2085;(RahXephon);Quon Kisaragi;The beginning exists for the end and the end exists for the beginning.;;;;;;;;
2086;(Shokugeki no Sōma);Jōichirō Yukihira;"Everyone wants to think like this: ""It can't be helped if I lose against someone with talent"". Like that, be it consciously or unconsciously... People put a lid on their hearts. They want to protect their pride, self-esteem... or whatever.";;;;;;;;
2087;(Trigun);Rem Saverem;The choices we make in life have unlimited possibilities.;;;;;;;;
2088;(Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road);Ame;Without what you call absolute power, we'll be able to live free and strong... That's why I have to end this. Humans often betray, fight and do terrible things to each other, but if I can feel this heat and this pain in my heart, a future where everyone will be kind to each other will definitely come some day. I can believe in it now!;;;;;;;;
2089;(Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo);The Count of Monte Cristo;I no longer even dream, for I no longer sleep. So I had this golden enclosed garden made. However, now the only place where I can be myself is in this room. And my wealth is just this one glass of water.;;;;;;;;
2090;(Hajimete no Aku);Jiro's Dad;"What is evil? Is it the bad side of society? Breaking the Law? Indeed, those are evil, but the true essence of ""evil"" is different.";;;;;;;;
Both justice and evil require you to carry out your own ego; in this there is no difference.;;;;;;;;;;
It's simply a question about the majority against minority.;;;;;;;;;;;
In today's world; the majority follows the rules. That can't be helped.;;;;;;;;;;
So does that mean we; the minority; are wrong? No. Even if it means the entire world is our enemy;" we persist. That is """"evil"""".""";;;;;;;;
2091;(To Love-Ru Darkness);Konjiki No Yami;Love always happens without warning. At that time, the gears of fate will start spinning. Just like the hands of a clock, two people’s hearts will separate and meet again. Eventually, they reunite.;;;;;;;;
2092;(Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence);Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence;Life and death come and go like marionettes dancing on a table. Once their stings are cut, they easily crumble.;;;;;;;;
2093;(Fushigi Yugi);Tamahome;Don't ever forget that with each step a person is able to take on their own, they have become that much stronger.;;;;;;;;

2098;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;If you truly desire greatness, you must first know what makes you weak!;;;;;;;;
2099;(Naruto Shippuuden);Might Guy;It's not always possible to do what we want to do, but it's important to believe in something before you actually do it.;;;;;;;;
2100;(Kodomo no Jikan);Kyouko Houin;The opposite of love isn't hate, it’s apathy.  ;;;;;;;;

2104;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;If you were given the chance to redo your life, would you take it?;;;;;;;;
2105;(Princess Tutu);Edel;The beginning of a story is a sudden event;;;;;;;;
2106;(Puella Magi Madoka Magica);Junko Kaname;That sort of thing happens all the time. You get drunk on your own “correctness,” and the more stubborn you get, the further happiness flies away from you. It’s a bitter pill to swallow.;;;;;;;;
2107;(Shinmai Maou no Testament);Yahiro Takigawa;The envy of a man runs deeper than a woman's, surprisingly.;;;;;;;;
2108;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Kyouya Sata;If you truly loved her, you'd save her even if you were weak or it would be painful. That's the pride of a man;;;;;;;;
2109;(Detective Conan);Miwako Sato;Justice isn’t something that you can just proclaim. It’s a feeling you should keep near your heart.;;;;;;;;
2110;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Shizuka Hiratsuka;Trying to not hurt others is something you can’t do. People are creatures who hurt others just by existing even if they’re not aware of it. Whether you’re living or dying, you’ll always be hurting someone. Once you’re involved, you’ll hurt someone, and even by not being involved, you might be hurting someone else as well…;;;;;;;;
2111;(Isshūkan Friends);Kaori Fujimiya;Math is like a puzzle or a game. There's a clear answer, and you're going on a journey to find it. But there are many ways to reach that answer. That's why it's so fulfilling when you find the solution. There are ways to find an answer promptly, or more freely. Even roundabout methods can bring you to a definite solution. The method may not be pretty, but when the answer you worked hard to discover is right, it makes you happy.;;;;;;;;
2112;(Silver Spoon);Yoshiyuki Nakajima;There are things that you can only learn by facing the unknown, be it a different species, different values, or upbringing.;;;;;;;;
2113;(Silver Spoon);Juui;In all things, I think having a dream requires having the resolve to struggle with reality.;;;;;;;;
2114;(So Ra No Wo To);Rio Kazumiya;A dream? That's right. Because there was the past, there is now the present. And because there is the present, we can believe in tomorrow and pursue our dreams.;;;;;;;;
2115;(Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou);Rachnera Arachnera;You're free to like or hate whoever you want.;;;;;;;;
2116;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Maou;If it's the army's job to end a war, it's the king's job to find a place for it to end.;;;;;;;;
2117;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Kyouya Sata;"Girls who push their kindness onto others. I hate them to death. ""I have a really beautiful heart, so please fall in love with me!"" I'm only surrounded by these types of girls and they piss me off. But it's not that simple. In the end, they are just making a fool of themselves. But you... You're different from the other girls. You don't have ulterior motives or anything to gain. You've always been easygoing. That's why to you, I thought It'd be okay to at least say thank you.";;;;;;;;
2118;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;
2119;(Aria the Animation);Alicia Florence;"Have you heard this story before? When a certain traveler left on a journey in search of what he desired, he was told by his teacher: ""You mustn't lose your way, because if you make one wrong turn - you will never find what you were searching for"". But, unfortunately, the traveler lost his way and hung his head in dismay... But when he raised his head again, what he saw before him was a world even more magnificent than what the traveler was searching for. It means if you don't make mistakes, there are things you won't discover.";;;;;;;;
2120;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;If it’s possible for one person to be hurt by another, then it’s possible for that person to be healed by another.;;;;;;;;

2124;(Gintama);Ichi Terakado;There’s no such thing as parents who don’t think about their children. But there are few children who understand their parents feelings.;;;;;;;;
2125;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;The greatest freedom is the freedom not to get involved.;;;;;;;;
2126;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;For as long as human history goes on, the past will continue to accumulate. History isn’t just records of the past. It’s also proof that civilization has continued to advance to the present. Our present civilization is the result of our past.;;;;;;;;
2127;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Dante (Fullmetal Alchemist);People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a reason... But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are born into wealth without ever working at all. It's a cruel and random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful. ;;;;;;;;

2129;(Working!!);Aoi Yamada;You don’t waste your time following someone around unless you like him. Stalking is a sign of love.;;;;;;;;
2130;(Silver Spoon);Aki Mikage (Silver Spoon);Remember how you're supposed to let go right away when you fall off a horse and hit the ground? You don't need to hurt yourself for no reason. If you don't let go, you'll get dragged by the horse and get hurt.;;;;;;;;

2132;(Servant X Service);Yutaka Hasebe;Everyone has something they like, something they have to do, or something they want to do.;;;;;;;;
2133;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Kyouya Sata;"Boyfriends and girlfriends just want to be flooded with feelings of ""Aah, I feel such fulfillment"". They don't really love their partner. ";;;;;;;;
2134;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Kyouya Sata;"Saying things like ""It would be troubling for her"" are just really convenient excuses for yourself. If you can forgive yourself like this, then you can just enjoy staying in your comfort zone, right?";;;;;;;;
2135;(Hanasaku Iroha);Tooru Miyagishi;You may come to a standstill or get irritated because things don't work out the way you want them to, but what you gain from hard work will never betray you.;;;;;;;;
2136;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;If there is such a thing like happiness in this world, it should resemble the endless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing and having nothing to lose. If that isn't happiness... then what is?;;;;;;;;
2137;(Aoi Sekai no Chuushin de);Tejirof;Nobody will admire you just because you are strong. People respect the ones that choose the difficult path, even if they're weak.;;;;;;;;
2138;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;This is a world where people’s hearts are filled with hatred... where fingers have no purpose other than to pull triggers.;;;;;;;;
2139;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;First you must decide, then you must follow through. I believe that’s the only way you can get anything accomplished.;;;;;;;;
2140;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;I look like I'm suffering, huh? That's not good... But of course I'd be suffering. I mean, I'm gonna sail in uncharted waters, right? Both, taking on a challenge and creating something. It is painful, but it's fulfilling. ;;;;;;;;
2141;(Stella Jogakuin Koutou-ka C³-bu);Sonora Kashima;It may seem like we're all playing the same game, but in our minds, it is totally different.;;;;;;;;
2142;(Shirobako);Midori Imai;I just realized I love learning things that I don't know anything about. It sort of feels like I'm one step closer to my dream.;;;;;;;;
2143;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;We’re all afraid, you know.. to get up on stage. Maybe you’ll mess up. Maybe they’ll totally reject you. Even so, you grit your teeth and get up on stage anyway. Something compels us… moves us to play music.;;;;;;;;
2144;(Ping Pong The Animation);Ryuuichi Kazama;There's no shortcut to victory. You have to climb that steep mountain one step at a time. There's an abyss down below and it never ends. Your only choice is to keep climbing!;;;;;;;;
2145;(Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season);Honoka Kousaka;Since I was a little girl, I acted before I spoke. Sometimes I inconvenienced those around me. I wasn't very good at expressing myself and was awkward... But that's when I found songs! Songs allow you to honestly convey your feelings. By singing, you can feel the same as others. By singing, you can connect with others. That's why I love songs. I love singing!;;;;;;;;
2146;(Little Busters!);Riki Naoe;People can never truly understand each other! That's why we communicate and try to understand. We can only understand ourselves through being with others!;;;;;;;;
2147;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;I don't care what normal people do anymore. I'm going to live my life the way that I want to.;;;;;;;;
2148;(Kokoro Connect);Taichi Yaegashi;What you can't accomplish alone, becomes doable when you're with someone else.;;;;;;;;
2149;(Kokoro Connect);Ryuuzen Gotou;You'll discover that problems have a way of working themselves out if you talk to your friends.;;;;;;;;
2150;(Nisekoi);Tachibana Marika;My, my! Do I really need to spell it out for you? There is nothing that you can acquire without making a move on your own. It's the same with romance - your only hope is to be more aggressive.;;;;;;;;
2151;(Kuroko No Basket);Midorima Shintarou;In the world of sports, quickness doesn't necessarily mean having the fastest time. It could also mean the acceleration from zero to maximum speed or the deceleration from maximum speed to zero. This is known as agility.;;;;;;;;
2152;(Kino No Tabi);Kino;It's interesting, isn't it? The way that when someone expresses something, someone else always shows up to interpret it.;;;;;;;;
2153;(Tamayura);Grandmother Sawatari;A great enough sorrow can stop time, but someday, time will start moving again. No matter how many years may pass.;;;;;;;;
2154;(Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne!);Ginbei Haruomi Sawatari;I don't want someone that can easily be replaced by others. What I need is... what I really want is... someone that will be with me no matter what. A best friend.;;;;;;;;
2155;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;When boys get to a certain age, family becomes a bother. That's how they become independent.;;;;;;;;

2157;(Kuroko No Basket);Daiki Aomine;I won't say you'll definitely be able to do it if you don't give up. But if you do give up, then there'll definitely be nothing.;;;;;;;;
2158;(Ryuugajou Nanana No Maizoukin);Juugo Yama;Don’t make decisions on your own without saying what’s important.;;;;;;;;
2159;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;You were wrong on two counts. Even the hardest substance can be broken, when crashed into itself. And the ability to feel pain is not a weakness. It’s a strength. Pain tells a creature its vulnerabilities, and not you expose them to attack. Your robot is dead. And so, I’m afraid, are you.;;;;;;;;
2160;(Devil Survivor 2);Alcor;Why have I come to have this conscience? If it’s this agonizing, I shouldn’t have had it. Just what am I?;;;;;;;;
2161;(Devil Survivor 2);Yamato Hotsuin;I care not if you call me an enemy. I shall bring you to submission.;;;;;;;;
2162;(Devil Survivor 2);Fumi Kanno;This is all that remains of the world. Though we knew it was coming, it’s pretty shocking, huh? The disappearance not of matter but of awareness, of ideals. Not death. Something even more pure. The fact that we life-forms ever existed…… Our past, present and future, it will all disappear.;;;;;;;;
2163;(Devil Survivor 2);Devil Survivor 2;What is Living? Living is continuing to make choices. Living is enjoying oneself. Living is continuing to make choices. Living is expressing one’s will. Living is enjoying oneself. Living is continuing to search. Living is eating. Living is continuing to fight. Living is being lost. Living is preparing oneself.;;;;;;;;
2164;(Devil Survivor 2);Yamato Hotsuin;Our world is like a terminal cancer. Saying you’ll change things through individual will is the rambling of a peace-loving fool. Why don’t you understand it’s too late for humanity?!;;;;;;;;
2165;(Voices of a Distant Star);Mikako Nagamine;We are far, far, very, very far apart... but it might be that thoughts can overcome time and distance.;;;;;;;;

2173;(No Game No Life);Tet;In reality, the least interesting answer is usually the correct one.;;;;;;;;

2178;(Mashiroiro Symphony - The color of lovers);Angelina Nanatsu Sewell;You’re like big umbrella. You’re the shade from the strong sun’s rays when the weather is good. And you’re the shelter from the cold rain when the weather is bad. You’re always protecting others.;;;;;;;;
2179;(Mashiroiro Symphony - The color of lovers);Sana Inui;I guess I just want the person I love to be happy. I just want to do something for him.;;;;;;;;
2180;(Love Lab);Rentarou Kurahashi;Girls who are pretty and pure only exist in fantasies.;;;;;;;;
2181;(Love Lab);Rentarou Kurahashi;Girls are so annoying. They’re always stubborn and full of jealousy, gossiping about who gets along with whom and who loves whom. Violent too.;;;;;;;;

2188;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;Even if I'm not around, nothing will change, you say? It's not as if I'm living my life to prove something silly like that! We live our lives to see how the world changes around us, don't you think?;;;;;;;;
2189;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;But I think it’s natural that not everything you try will go well, right? So, I’m gonna start again from scratch.;;;;;;;;
2190;(Wolf’s Rain);Cher Degre;You know I think I understand now why you and I never had children…on some level we knew the world was ending, it may of seemed like we had found something else to obsess over but the truth is we’d given up on the future. That’s the real reason I was never able to get pregnant.;;;;;;;;
2191;(BlazBlue: Alter Memory);Hazama;This whole world is nothing but lies, lies! Lemme show you what I like to call the truth, the truth called despair!;;;;;;;;
2192;(BlazBlue: Alter Memory);Hakumen;I am the white void, I am the cold steel, I am the just sword, with blade in hand shall I reap the sins of this world, and cleanse them in the fires of destruction! I am Hakumen! The end has come.;;;;;;;;
2193;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yūsei Fudō;The future isn’t written yet. There’s still time for things to change! ;;;;;;;;
2194;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;I hate waiting, but if waiting means being able to be with you I'll wait for as long as forever.;;;;;;;;
2195;(Kokoro Connect);Himeko Inaba;Never forget that kindness can hurt instead of help.;;;;;;;;
2196;(Kokoro Connect);Himeko Inaba;If I show people how weak I am, they won't need me anymore.;;;;;;;;
2197;(Cardfight!! Vanguard: Link Joker Hen);Toshiki Kai;Right now, I'm going to fight the person who freed me from being Reversed and saved the world. The strongest fighter... My best friend.;;;;;;;;
2198;(Kuroko No Basket);Taiga Kagami;With out strong opponents, living isn't fun. It's perfect if I can't win.;;;;;;;;
2199;(Bokura ga Ita);Masafumi Takeuchi;If it's going to be a relationship of hardship and mental agony, you should put an end to it.;;;;;;;;
2200;(Bokura ga Ita);Nanami Takahashi;How should I put this... There are times when you begin to hate everything around you.;;;;;;;;
2201;(Tamayura);Norie Okazaki;Even if it’s a coincidence, it’s wonderful when someone understands how you feel.;;;;;;;;
2202;(Akuma To Love Song);Shin Meguro;There are those people who are born aloof and prefer to stay away from groups. In such a case, others should just leave those people alone. It's not a matter of sympathy.;;;;;;;;
2203;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;The pain of getting hit, the frustration of loosing, the joy of winning, all of that. They've been driven into this body, fists, and this head. It becomes my strength in the next fight. All of my battles up to now, those memories, they are all of my power.;;;;;;;;
2204;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;As far as relationships with other people go, they don't just end because one person decides that it's over.;;;;;;;;
2205;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;If we're going to regret it either way, then let's regret doing something fun that we wanted to do.;;;;;;;;
2206;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;Don't go thinking that there's a world where it's natural to be happy! Even if you start complaining, nothing will change! You need to make things fun by yourself!;;;;;;;;
2207;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;If you’re too lucky, people will get jealous of you.;;;;;;;;
2208;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;In this world, who knows who might kill who.;;;;;;;;
2209;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;There’s no use. There’s no such thing as a victory that can be won through effort. It doesn’t exist.;;;;;;;;
2210;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;They say time and a people’s heart are inversely proportional. The more it passes, the more they grow apart. It seems there are some rare exceptions though.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2213;(K Project);Yashiro Isana;"Regardless of who I was in the past or what I did, I feel like ""me"" of the present should take responsibility.";;;;;;;;
2214;(Solanin);Meiko Inoue;The scenery is so peaceful, you'd never think that wars were happening and people were dying around the world. If only this scenery could continue forever. But even if a time should come when I can no longer enjoy this scenery, as long as everyone is with me, I'll be fine. That's what I think today.;;;;;;;;
2215;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;It's pretty hard just to survive as a human being. The world's a big place and there's a lot of stuff I don't understand, but I think there must be something important out there. I mean, that's what I want to believe. If I keep believing that while playing music, then maybe I'll be able to change the world just a bit.;;;;;;;;
2216;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;Sorry, a trick is nothing but a puzzle mankind came up with. If you use your head, you can uncover the logical answer. It’s disappointing. No matter the explanation I think of, I cannot understand why one person would kill another. Even if I can see why, I can’t understand why. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2218;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Fullmetal Alchemist;Men are not men on the battlefield. We turn into some other creature. You can do the cruelest things... It doesn't even matter if it's an order or not. To protect yourself, your mind shuts out any emotions you have. It's like a steel door. But once the war is over, you can't keep it closed forever. ;;;;;;;;
2219;(Panty And Stocking With Gaterbelt);Anarchy Stocking;We’re always serious. We’re seriously joking around. ;;;;;;;;
2220;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;I mean, think about it. If someone pointed to a classmate of yours and asked you what they meant to you, how would you answer? What would you say? ;;;;;;;;
2221;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Rejection is a part of any man’s life. If you can’t accept and move past rejection, or at least use it as writing material - you’re not a real man. ;;;;;;;;
2222;(Durarara!!×2 Shou);Izaya Orihara;You know how they have parameters in games? Like, you're good at magic, but your combat skills blow, or you're a great fighter, but you lack in the brains department.;;;;;;;;
2223;(Tokyo Ghoul: Jack);Kishou Arima;Events that happen in this world, are a continuous series of trifling things, and within those myriad pieces of puzzles, there is always a fragment that leads to the truth.;;;;;;;;
2224;(NANA);Yasushi Takagi;Being alone and being lonely are two different things.;;;;;;;;
2225;(NANA);Nana Komatsu;Nobu is idealizing me, that’s why he fell in love with me. If you knew the real me, it would shatter your illusion. Then come on. Shatter my illusion. Because I don’t know what else I can do to stop loving you.;;;;;;;;
2226;(Akame ga KILL!);Tatsumi;Everyone has their own reasons to fight! Sometimes, you have to settle it yourself or there's no way forward!;;;;;;;;
2227;(Tamako Market);Dera Mochimazzi;Everybody loves somebody. In time, everybody falls in love with somebody. Just as I found you.;;;;;;;;
2228;(Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?);Harumi Sakuraba;Regardless of whether your friends believe, you still care for them, correct? Isn't that why you feel so sad?;;;;;;;;
2229;(Kuroko No Basket);Hyuuga Junpei;“Your hard work will be rewarded.” What kind of idiot came up with that nonsense?;;;;;;;;
2230;(Rokujouma no Shinryakusha!?);Kiriha Kurano;I don’t like hurting others. But that doesn't mean I won’t bear arms to protect places and people dear to me.;;;;;;;;
2231;(Ryuugajou Nanana No Maizoukin);Nanana Ryuugajou;I won’t lose to my own decisions, no matter what. That’s the proof that I’m me.;;;;;;;;
2232;(5 Centimeters per Second);Takaki Tohno;I’m just trying to live my life, but it seems as if sadness always piles itself up around me. It’s in my bed, the toothbrush in my bathroom, and the memory of my cellphone. Over the past few years, I’ve wanted to move on, I’ve wanted to take hold of something I couldn’t reach. What that is, I have no idea. Not knowing where such obsessive thoughts were coming from, I simply drowned myself in my work. Then one day I realized that my heart was withering, and in it there was nothing but pain. And that my beliefs, that I once held so passionately, had completely disappeared.;;;;;;;;
2233;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;It’s because we help out when they’re in trouble that we can count on them to come running when we need it.;;;;;;;;
2234;(Chihayafuru);Hidehiro Harada;Frustrations will not last forever. Nobody can keep on going without some measure of reward.;;;;;;;;
2235;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;People who aren't doing anything themselves, shouldn't be so quick to tell others what to do!;;;;;;;;
2236;(Again!!);Kinichirou Imamura;What I hate the most in the world is when I'm already trying hard and I'm told to try harder!;;;;;;;;
2237;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;The ability to understand others just by touching definitely exists. There might not be any reason to be afraid of touching and being touched by others, or hugging and being hugged by others.;;;;;;;;
2238;(Deadman Wonderland);Kiyomasa Senji;Only frustrated adults and naive kids believe themselves to be special.;;;;;;;;
2239;(Akame ga KILL!);Mine;No one would help me. And that's when I understood... That only I could help myself. ;;;;;;;;
2240;(Kotoura-san);Daichi Muroto;Words are shallow. Just talking doesn't bring world peace.;;;;;;;;
2241;(Kimi ni Todoke);Sawako Kuronuma;Because we can’t understand each other, it makes us want to make things clear even more.;;;;;;;;
2242;(Hentai Ouji To Warawanai Neko);Yokodera Youto;You don’t need something from someone else. What you need is to make your heart stronger. If you act naturally, people will naturally like you. And I’d like you more that way too.;;;;;;;;
2243;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Ironic, isn't it? How people without truly important things know about them more than those who have them.;;;;;;;;
2244;(Gintama);Kotarō Katsura;But I suppose it’s not so bad that an old friend is the same as ever.;;;;;;;;
2245;(Fairy Tail);Ichiya Vandalay Kotobuki;Everyone makes mistakes, but then you recover. Look at all of the friends you have here who adore you. It would be difficult for anything to change that. If you keep that in mind, you should be able to get back on your feet any number of times.;;;;;;;;
2246;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;When you’re in love, you start to worry about the most trivial details. It should feel really restrictive, but worrying about this kind of thing makes me really happy instead.;;;;;;;;
2247;(Ao Haru Ride);Youichi Tanaka;Your high school life will be over before you know it. There are things you can only do now. You should do as many of them as you can.;;;;;;;;
2248;(Nagi no Asukara);Hikari Sakishima;Having feelings for someone just brings sorrow to someone else. Someone always gets sacrificed and suffers. If this is what it means to fall in love, then falling in love is terrible.;;;;;;;;
2249;(Mushishi Zoku Shou);Ginko;If you throw your life away, you won't even have the capacity to feel regret.;;;;;;;;
2250;(No.6);Sion;Where do people stray off the path? When do they begin to obey their greed rather than their ideals? Or are ideals just prone to morphing easily into greed?;;;;;;;;
2251;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;I'm not very good at sensing people's boundaries. Without knowing how far is too far, I gradually get closer and closer. It's terrifying. Being unable to sense that is terrifying.;;;;;;;;
2252;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;He who lies to make things beautiful is probably someone who admires pure feelings much more than anybody else.;;;;;;;;
2253;(World Trigger);Osamu Mikumo;I am not a hero. I can't make anyone happy with any result. I can only do what I deem right with me not hating my choice at a later point.;;;;;;;;
2254;(Deadman Wonderland);Ganta Igarashi;If you're gonna kill me, then kill me. If you're gonna execute me, stop waiting. Until then, I live by my own rules!;;;;;;;;
2255;(Deadman Wonderland);Nagi Kengamine;The only people who make me feel remorse are those that do not possess any willpower.;;;;;;;;
2256;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;Why do you still want to be my friend? Is it because you feel comfortable being with me? Because I understand your awkward and useless self, and yet still love you? Quit acting so spoiled. When you rejected me, you lost the right to want those things!;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2258;(Mushishi);Amane;If you could see everything but couldn't change any of it, or if you could live in freedom in darkness... Which do you think is more fortunate? I think it might not be that bad living in the dark, remembering the light.;;;;;;;;
2259;(Golden Time);Hayashida Nana;You were like a bomb, one wrong move and I might have lost you again.;;;;;;;;
2260;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;The Present is ending. Here, countless versions of our past selves are always crying, laughing, falling in love, getting hurt, joking around, feeling happy and suffering. These feelings are born all the time and in the next moment, they became the past and die. It's over now. This is the end, but the truth is everyone's time is like that. Right after it's born, every moment becomes the past and dies.;;;;;;;;
2261;(Golden Time);Kaga Kouko;Worrying about rejection may be the same as rejecting yourself.;;;;;;;;
2262;(Golden Time);Kaga Kouko;If a person you love doesn't love you back, you're worthless. That's what I always told myself.;;;;;;;;
2263;(Golden Time);Kaga Kouko;I want to spend a lot more time with you! But I don’t want you to think I’m annoying, so I’m holding myself back. When you’re away, I always wonder what you’re doing and thinking.;;;;;;;;
2264;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;I may be unreliable, and I may not be able to do anything, but I’m here. I’ll always be with you. I’ll be always by your side.;;;;;;;;
2265;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;When you want to scream or cry, I’ll be there. I’ll share your feelings and stay with you.;;;;;;;;
2266;(Golden Time);Tada Banri;Even if you think I’m a nuisance, no matter where you go, I’ll find you. I’ll always be listening for your voice. When the rain falls, when the wind blows, when the flowers scatter, when shadow looms. In every sign, I’ll search for your voice.;;;;;;;;
2267;(Golden Time);Kaga Kouko;I don’t want to waste a single second or meter. From your first step and second of the day, I want to be with you.;;;;;;;;
2268;(Golden Time);Nana;You meet someone and then part ways. It’s a natural part of the human experience. No one can promise they’ll be together forever.;;;;;;;;
2269;(Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge);Haimura Kiri;If you don’t interact with the people around you, it’d be hard for anyone to approach you.;;;;;;;;
2270;(Kimi no Iru Machi);Haruto Kirishima;I have to be her place to belong. I need to be a steady, reliable man whom she can trust.;;;;;;;;
2271;(Kimi no Iru Machi);Haruto Kirishima;Aren’t we family? Aren’t I like your family too? So it’s okay to cry if you’re having a hard time. Then I’ll do anything to help.;;;;;;;;
2272;(Kimi no Iru Machi);Yuzuki Eba;As long as I can be with you, I dont care what anyone says or how much I’m detested. As long as I can be with the one I love, that alone makes it okay. That’s what I longed for.;;;;;;;;
2273;(Kanon);Aizawa Yuuichi;In this world, there are things you’re better off not knowing.;;;;;;;;
2274;(Little Busters!);Futaki Kanata;It may be better to go and regret it rather than staying here and regretting it. If you don’t move forward, you can’t gain anything.;;;;;;;;
2275;(Little Busters!);Noumi Kudoryafuka;I’m a very lucky person. I was able to meet people I love.;;;;;;;;
2276;(Little Busters!);Kamikita Komari;No matter what, I’ll be always be your friend. No matter how far you go, I’ll be thinking about you everyday.;;;;;;;;
2277;(07 Ghost);Bastien;Only a genuine wish makes one's own soul shine beautifully in this life. That light is a messenger from heaven lighting the way for our unwavering souls to be brought to the God's side.;;;;;;;;
2278;(Sword Art Online II);Kazuto Kirigaya;No one dies alone. When someone dies, the part of them that lives inside someone else also dies. You already live inside me.;;;;;;;;
2279;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;I don’t believe in crap like coincidence, fate, or destiny.;;;;;;;;
2280;(Tamako Market);Dera Mochimazzi;I don’t want to change. I want to change. We all hold in our hearts conflicting feelings, each back to back. And so, we live our days.;;;;;;;;
2281;(Kagerou Days);Kozakura Marry;The others taught me something. That one needn't fear the future. That one needn't hate the world. From now on, the world will not simply be my fantasy. It will be our one and only, real future.;;;;;;;;
2282;(NANA);Nana Osaki;People say that if you fight, it means you're close to someone;;;;;;;;
2283;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;It’s like an automated vending machine for canned juice. You’ll get what you want so long as you have the money, but… You get nothing in return without it. You can’t buy your way into the hearts of others.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2285;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Reinhard von Lohengramm;Something that's supposed to die and doesn't will eventually rot away, whether it's a man or a nation.;;;;;;;;
2286;(Detective Conan);Hattori Heiji;Life is short so it will be appreciated. We live to our fullest due to that.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2288;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Yozora Mikazuki;You don't need to make a hundred friends. Just make real friends that you care about a hundred times as much. Even if you only have one, so long as they’re a friend you really care about.;;;;;;;;
2289;(Ao Haru Ride);Yoshioka Futaba;If what you lost was too big and you can’t replace it with something else, you don’t have to replace it with just one thing, right? If you get ten small things or a hundred small things, all together it will be enough of a reason for you to keep going!;;;;;;;;
2290;(Shinsekai Yori);Saki Watanabe;We have to change our way of thinking if we really want to change the future.;;;;;;;;
2291;(Deadman Wonderland);Nagi Kengamine;Everyone's fighting for their own kind of freedom. It seems small;;;;;;;;
2292;(Little Busters!);Yuiko Kurugaya;I don’t mind getting in trouble. But I won’t let my friends' kindness go to waste.;;;;;;;;
2293;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;Every story has an ending. One day, we won’t be able to stay together.;;;;;;;;
2294;(Un-Go);Yuuki Shinjuurou;People get corrupted. Not even saints and heroes are safe. There's nothing you can do to prevent it. That's our salvation.;;;;;;;;
2295;(Cowboy Bebop: The Movie);Vincent Volaju;Of the days that I have lived, only those I spent with you seemed real.;;;;;;;;
2296;(Hayate the Combat Butler);Hinagiku Katsura;There are times when there's a great pleasure waiting at the end of laments, pains, and near-death experiences.;;;;;;;;
2297;(Chrono Crusade);Aion;Even at a time like this there's not a single word of rescue from the one you worship. You see? That is the truth of this world. He doesn't watch anything and doesn't save anyone.;;;;;;;;
2298;(Ah! My Goddess: The Movie);Morgan Le Fay;If things were to change, do you think you could ever fall in love with me? Or fulfill a dream for which I long? The world is about to change. That's why I'm here now. I've come and this will mean a new beginning for my life.;;;;;;;;
2299;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;It’s not that I’m a tolerant person. I just don’t want to think about these troublesome things.;;;;;;;;
2300;(CLANNAD);Yoshino Yūsuke;He realized that he had lost sight of something important. No matter what turn he took he should have kept singing. Even if his songs couldn’t save the world, he could still sing songs for her. Don’t ever lose sight of what’s important to you.;;;;;;;;
2301;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;What defines humans... Defines us? Nobody will notice a change on the inside if you look the same on the outside.;;;;;;;;
2302;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;You’d better not (rip my mask). Like Pandora’s box, you want to open it because you don’t know what’s inside. But if you know what’s inside before you open it… It’s boring, isn’t it? ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2304;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles);Yūko Ichihara;It is called the memories of the body. When the mind forgets, the body remembers for it.;;;;;;;;
2305;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Someone who cannot hate something, cannot love something, either.;;;;;;;;
2306;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;I understand your feelings of wanting to bring the bad guy to justice, but do bear with it. It also requires courage to hide oneself.;;;;;;;;
2307;(Detective Conan);Detective Conan;The right thing is… to have faith in life, until you’re sure of death. That’s what makes a great detective. ;;;;;;;;
2308;(Detective Conan);Subaru Okiya;If you force me to pick one… It’d be black. It covers up the things inside of me that I don’t want to be known about. Well, for the same reason… Black is the color I hate too.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2312;(Shinsekai Yori);Maria Akitsuki;Once the kiln is opened and the pottery inspected, all that are crooked or bear cracks are fated to be smashed. If all that awaited us was the fate of smashed pottery, then we decided we would rather run away in the hopes of finding a different future.;;;;;;;;
2313;(Sword Art Online II);Konno Yuuki;You hit me with everything you had, so I decided I could trust you with everything I had.;;;;;;;;
2314;(Brynhildr in the Darkness);Ichijiku Chisato;It's a foolish thing, the human heart. Sometimes we fail to operate logically, and act on emotions.;;;;;;;;
2315;(Midnight Secretary);Touma Kyohei;I am ME. No matter, what I say or do, I'm still ME. The things I feel, the things I do, being a vampire, being a man, being betrayed by my mother. When all those things come together, they make up ME. But I'm none of these things taken separately.;;;;;;;;
2316;(Ghost in the Shell);Puppet Master;Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.;;;;;;;;
2317;(Free!);Rin Matsuoka;No amount of natural talent trumps hard work.;;;;;;;;
2318;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;Even if it is shameless and vulgar, somewhere I seek some sort of connection with people.;;;;;;;;
2319;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;The shadow of your former self won't vanish.;;;;;;;;
2320;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;No matter how hard you try, you cannot exceed your true capabilities.;;;;;;;;
2321;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;Even if this is a twisted way to go about it, even if a guaranteed way to save our hearts cannot be found, even so, it doesn't mean that people like us don't try and struggle.;;;;;;;;
2322;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;If it's this world behind the eyelids, anybody can become the person I imagine them to be.;;;;;;;;
2323;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;I never wanted anybody to hate me. I don't belong to any groups, and I have to fight and struggle to build myself up. In the end, all I want is just to not be hated by everyone.;;;;;;;;
2324;(Onanie Master Kurosawa);Kakeru Kurosawa;I'm prepared for it all. Even if my chest hurts, even if I'm ripped apart, I won't let myself taste any regret.;;;;;;;;
2325;(Texhnolyze);Keigo Oonishi;If the only way to be granted life in this world is to surrender my body and soul to insanity, then I shall choose to meet my doom!;;;;;;;;
2326;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;You see, for as long as we draw breath into our lungs, we shall keep hope alive inside our hearts.;;;;;;;;
2327;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;They are those who come and go as they please. Even so, once you come to know them, even though there's no one else who notices them, it's a precious encounter that will keep your heart strong.;;;;;;;;
2328;(Hunter X Hunter);Killua Zoldyck;Not killing people is really hard. Clean living is tough.;;;;;;;;
2329;(Prince Of Tennis);Ryoma Echizen;You know, a lot of people make excuses when they lose.;;;;;;;;
2330;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Yozora Mikazuki;It's not like I'm desperate to have friends, anyway. I just don't like being looked down on as that sad person with no friends.;;;;;;;;
2331;(Texhnolyze);Yoshii Kazuho;True freedom can't lean on anything. It's transient, lonely, and arduous.;;;;;;;;
2332;(Boogiepop Phantom);Seiichi Kirima;The brain is a microcosm, creating its own stories. People then live out these stories.;;;;;;;;
2333;(D.Gray-man);Millenium Earl;You think I'm making demons simply as weapons, but demons are created by the human soul.;;;;;;;;
2334;(Nabari no Ou);Kouichi Aizawa;The strength of life lies in the possibility of dying.;;;;;;;;
2335;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;There's probably no one who's more of a realist than the unpopular loner. I have lived my life with the Three Nevers of the Unpopular: Never to hold (hope), Never to open (your heart), and Never to treasure (sweet words).;;;;;;;;
2336;(One Outs);Toua Tokuchi;What does it mean to be a winner? Is it the last one standing? It means to climb over a mountain of corpses to get to the top. By no means is it a glorious sight to behold, in fact, it is extremely cruel. Even so, if you still wish to seek victory... then you must become a devil.;;;;;;;;
2337;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Dictatorship itself isn't absolutely evil, it's just another form of government. The point is how you can run it for the benefit of society.;;;;;;;;
2338;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Hildegard von Mariendorf;Maybe humans are capable of committing far more shameless acts than they imagine they are. If they hadn’t faced adversity, they might have gone without discovering such ugly facets of themselves.;;;;;;;;
2339;(Boogiepop Phantom);Seiichi Kirima;Time does not exist. Only the illusion of memories exist.;;;;;;;;
2340;(True Tears);Noe Isurugi;Even in the darkness, I’m sure it’s reassuring to have someone there to walk with you.;;;;;;;;
2341;(Donten ni Warau);Tenka Kumō;Listen here. Don't say you can't. Words bind you the minute you say them. Believe in yourself! You can do anything!;;;;;;;;
2342;(Un-Go);Kaishou Rinroku;If all humans were saints and sages, all truths would be exposed. And every just cause, expedient, ideal, and lie would no longer be necessary, yes?;;;;;;;;
2343;(Naruto);Nagato;If you don't share someone's pain. You can never understand them.;;;;;;;;
2344;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Yukino Yukinoshita;If all you're good for is breathing in and out, then even an AC unit is more useful than you.;;;;;;;;
2345;(Hanamonogatari);Rouka Numachi;Even the worst evil saves something... even the greatest good hurts someone.;;;;;;;;
2346;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;It's meaningless to just live, and it's meaningless to just fight. I want to win.;;;;;;;;
2347;(Naruto);Pain;Love breeds sacrifice... which in turn breeds hatred. Then you can know pain.;;;;;;;;
2348;(Detective Conan);Vermouth;I wonder if there really is a God... If such an entity really existed, wouldn't all honest, hard-working people be happy? ;;;;;;;;
2349;(Detective Conan);Detective Conan;Be as swift as the wind. Be as quiet as the forest. Attack as fiercely as the fire. Be immovable like a mountain. Move like the lightning. Be as impenetrable as a shadow.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2352;(Gugure! Kokkuri-san);Shigaraki;People are born alone and die alone. But there isn't a single person who can keep standing alone forever. ;;;;;;;;
2353;(Ghost in the Shell);Motoko Kusanagi;Who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil? The mirror does not reflect evil, but creates it.;;;;;;;;
2354;(Shinsekai Yori);Shinsekai Yori;Arrogance can plant a seed of sin. And loneliness can serve as its nursery.;;;;;;;;
2355;(Serial Experiments Lain);Chisa Yomoda;There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer. In the real world, it didn't matter if I was there or not. When I realized that, I was no longer afraid of losing my body.;;;;;;;;
2356;(Detective Conan);Wataru Takagi;If it’s an important memory, then you shouldn't forget it. Since those who aren't with us only live on in our memories.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2358;(Monster);Johann Liebert;How weak the mind is when it wants to forget. Maybe you didn't forget. Maybe you're lying. Is it a lie you tell everyone around you, or perhaps a lie you tell yourself?;;;;;;;;
2359;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;The sea’s blue reflects because of the sky’s blue. Just like detectives and thieves. We’re all toying with the human mind. But the one who pries for others’ secrets is the one who’s truly impolite. ;;;;;;;;
2360;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;It's better trusting someone than to die doubting people altogether.;;;;;;;;
2361;(Psycho-Pass 2);Akane Tsunemori;Society doesn't always do what's right. That's exactly why we ourselves must live virtuous lives.;;;;;;;;
2362;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Perhaps in this universe, there exists a solitary, absolute truth. Perhaps it clarifies every question. But that’s beyond the reach of these short hands.;;;;;;;;
2363;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;What would you ask a grave, which can never reply? What do you pray for? Saying anything after someone's death is far too late.;;;;;;;;
2364;(Haibane Renmei);Renmei Communicator;Perhaps this is what it means to be bound by sin. To spin in the same circle, looking for where the sin lies, and at some point losing sight of the way out.;;;;;;;;
2365;(Haibane Renmei);Kuu;"Inside my mind, there's a beautiful cup. A very beautiful, clear cup. And tiny drops kept falling into it: ""drip, drip, drip"", slowly but steadily, everyday. And today, I felt the cup had finally become completely full.";;;;;;;;
2366;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Paul von Oberstein;All heroes have established their thrones atop, not just their enemies. But a large quantity of allied corpses as well. There are no monarchs with clean hands.;;;;;;;;
2367;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Children don't grow up looking at perfect parents. Rather, using their imperfect parents as anti-teachers, children nourish a spirit of independence.;;;;;;;;
2368;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Alex Cazellnu;Love and the human mind can't be analyzed with formulas. It's not so unusual for love to make you forget the sense of care and respect for others. There's no logic. It's an uncontrollable urge. To tell you the truth, it’d be worrisome if you became like that. Your mind is keen, and your character is good. But passion has nothing to do with mind or character.;;;;;;;;
2369;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;You can't perform the same trick twice with one audience. If performed only once, the magic leaves a strong impression. It will then blossom into a beautiful miracle in their hearts. But, when used twice, rather than the audience enjoying the magic, they focus on unraveling the trick. As such, the chance of it being unveiled is high. ;;;;;;;;
2370;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Kaworu Nagisa;Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts. Because the heart is so sensitive to pain, humans also feel that to live is to suffer.;;;;;;;;
2371;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;If you let anger and revenge consume you... You'll find yourself unable to behold the beautiful sights right before your eyes.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2373;(Sousei no Aquarion);Gen Fudou;A misty moonlight night washes over the land and though darkness ebbs with the glow of the full moon, shadows still remain. They conceal an evil which exists just beyond our grasp. Sides are chosen. Lines are drawn, ones that we dare not cross. But in the distance a ray of light shines to expose our path. It is then that we realize that some things in life are better left unseen.;;;;;;;;
2374;(Serial Experiments Lain);Serial Experiments Lain;History is not merely a linear collection of points that we pass through on a timeline. They are connected by a line. No, perhaps it is more accurate to say that they are made to connect.;;;;;;;;
2375;(Nabari no Ou);Kourin Shimizu;Swords exists for just judging and killing. They can never save others.;;;;;;;;
2376;(Akatsuki no Yona);Su-won;Do you want to kill me? It's only natural that you do. But I cannot die right now. Because there is something I must do.;;;;;;;;
2377;(Hanayamata);Masaru Ōfuna;Coming together and working hard with everyone is a really fun thing!;;;;;;;;
2378;(Sousei no Aquarion);Toma Epanort;On that day twelve thousand years ago, on the summit of clouds reaching the stratosphere, remember that evening when we watched the prominence rise from the sunspot together…;;;;;;;;
Entrusting our bodies to the Earth’s love; we listened carefully to the memories of the sea etched in every droplet of the falling rain that morning. When we looked up at the ocean’s singers who had gathered at the swaying great temple; the voices of prayer…;;;;;;;;;
That day; under the Tree of Life;" we entrusted the beginning of the world to those reverberations… Remember that brilliance.""";;;;;;;;;
2379;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Mei Tachibana;They'll use you as much as they want;;;;;;;;
2380;(Sousei no Aquarion);Gen Fudou;At night the moon shines with daylight. Our dreams are an ocean… each wave is the dream of an individual. The tide is controlled by the pull of the moon… it illuminates our dreams. If you open the moon, you will discover the path to dreams. When one finds death, they are submerged in the ocean of dreams. At the end of life’s path is a door that leads us to this ocean. Our dreams transcend the self to reach this sea… connecting us all within its lunar tide.;;;;;;;;
2381;(Sousei no Aquarion);Hong Lihua;Misfortune… that is my symbol. Unluckiness… that is my identity. I am a woman who looks best dressed in solitude and misfortune. That is who I am.;;;;;;;;
2382;(07 Ghost);Mikage;I swear to God that when we die, we'll die together. ;;;;;;;;
2383;(Tokyo Ghoul);Shuu Tsukiyama;"Isn't it arrogant to put a price on whether life is ""higher"" or ""lower"", Kaneki? We are just bags of meat. The weak bow down and the strong devour them. Rather, if you compared them to all living things, it's humans who have shaved away the most lives. We are different than them.";;;;;;;;
" """;;;;;;;;;;;
2384;(Tokyo Ghoul);Shuu Tsukiyama;You don't need to blame yourself just because you've hurt someone, just like when you're walking you can't really blame yourself to crush some ants... that's what being stronger ones means. ;;;;;;;;
2385;(Akatsuki no Yona);Jae-ha;Taking away someone's freedom is the ugliest thing one can do in this world. People like that ought to decay into dirt and come back as thorny roses.  ;;;;;;;;
2386;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;There were sad days, and painful ones and there may be more. Even so they're treasured days that I'll never forget.;;;;;;;;
2387;(Nichijou);Koujirou Sasahara;The ordinary days that we live in may, in fact, be a series of miracles.;;;;;;;;
2388;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;You need to accept the fact that you're not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face.;;;;;;;;
2389;(Death Note);L Lawliet;It's not a sense of justice. Figuring out difficult cases is my hobby. If you measured good and evil deeds by current laws, I would be responsible for many crimes. The same way you all like to solve mysteries and riddles, or clear video games more quickly. For me too, it's simply prolonging something I enjoy doing. That's why I only take on cases that pique my interest. It's not justice at all. And if it means being able to clear a case, I don't play fair, I'm a dishonest, cheating human being who hates losing.;;;;;;;;
2390;(Tokyo Ghoul);Shuu Tsukiyama;I'm not going to protect you by being your shield or armor, but I'll be the dagger hidden below your pillow.;;;;;;;;
2391;(Akatsuki no Yona);Su-won;Kindness is not a crime. But sometimes it awakens the weakness and greed in others.;;;;;;;;
2392;(Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou);Ritsu Kawai;Even though I don’t mind being alone, I don’t want others to think I’m lonely.;;;;;;;;
2393;(Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou);Kazunari Usa;I realized once again that my life is stuck on hard mode.;;;;;;;;
2394;(Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de);Jurai Andou;No matter how much this world may change, I shall always remain myself.;;;;;;;;
2395;(Akame ga KILL!);Mine;People who abuse power they were born into piss me off more than anything else.;;;;;;;;
2396;(Phantom: Requiem For The Phantom);Ein;If this world wasn't a complete hell for me, that's because you were alive.;;;;;;;;
2397;(Initial D: Fifth Stage);Ryosuke Takahashi;No matter how strong the pain is, it's our duty to move forward. You're wrong for running away from reality.;;;;;;;;
2398;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Shinji Ikari;I still don't know where to find happiness. But I'll continue to think about whether it's good to be here... whether it was good to have been born. But in the end, it's just realizing the obvious over and over again. Because I am myself.;;;;;;;;
2399;(Serial Experiments Lain);Taro;The truth has power because it's the truth. And because it is the truth, that makes it just. It's persuasive, isn't it? Don't you want truth like that?;;;;;;;;
2400;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;"My severe injuries had healed and the sweet taste of blood coated my mouth. I kept walking, my goal vague...trying to dispel the building unease in my chest... Upon entering an open area was the scent of rotting flowers and in the middle of the flowerbed, he stood... Without anyone saying a thing, without his name given, like an unsolved puzzle falling into place by itself, just by seeing that figure, I--understood exactly who I faced. The CCG's reaper. The undefeated ghoul investigator. A cold, vivid gaze. There, stood the God of Death. Why was it that I was seeing beauty in death rather than life? Strangely, I thought he was beautiful... Disoriented, I had failed to comprehend the scene before my eyes. It was not anything like flowers but a large amount of ""Death"". Had he done this alone?... It's a lie... Koma...Irimi...After all that... No matter how I tried to rouse my will to fight with hatred, more than sorrow, more than rage, the emotion that arose within me was despair. ";;;;;;;;
"Because 'my turn' was next.""";;;;;;;;;;;
2401;(Serial Experiments Lain);Lain Iwakura;No matter where you go, everyone's connected.;;;;;;;;
2402;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;I don’t need to believe in God to believe in myself.;;;;;;;;
2403;(Samurai X: Trust & Betrayal);Kenshin Himura;The moment you find the courage to give up your life for someone, would be the moment you understand love.;;;;;;;;
2404;(Sousei no Aquarion);Gen Fudou;How can he hope to stand back up, when he is still in the process of falling? Let him fall, all the way to the very bottom, before telling him to stand up again.;;;;;;;;
2405;(07 Ghost);Mikage Celestine;God doesn't give us trials we can't surmount. So someday all your wounds will heal and the day will come when you've surmounted all your pain.;;;;;;;;
2406;(Tokyo Ghoul);Yoshimura;...The act of taking is equally evil. We, from the moment of birth, continue to take. Food, connections, even fellow blood. Living to utmost. Continuing to slaughter, kill, take. Life is to constantly sin. Life is evil itself. I am aware I am evil... And so are you all. Now, come kill me. And I shall do the same!;;;;;;;;
2407;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kureo Mado;You only need a strong will and a clear purpose.;;;;;;;;
2408;(To Love-Ru);Rito Yuuki;If you smile once when you’re feeling down, you begin to feel better and become more cheerful.;;;;;;;;
2409;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;You shouldn't judge a person based on circumstantial evidence.;;;;;;;;
2410;(Ryuugajou Nanana No Maizoukin);Nanana Ryuugajou;Everyone wants to have someone else's attention, and to be noticed. But the same thing goes for the other person too.;;;;;;;;
2411;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;It is meaningless to distinguish between the beautiful and the ugly, or between the talented and the ordinary. Every human struggles to survive.;;;;;;;;

2414;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;I lie all the time. Who cares if you know something, but you say you don't? Forcing something out of someone without permission is worse.;;;;;;;;
2415;(Gaussian Blur);Choi Yool;...and even if you were to hate yourself as much as you want, you have no choice but to live with yourself forever. Other people just go by. Eventually what's left to you at the end is only yourself. Even if you can't seem to like yourself, shouldn't you at least compromise?;;;;;;;;
2416;(Gaussian Blur);Choi Yool;There's nothing known for certain. Adolescence is like that anyway. It's like a train ride with no destination and nobody. There's no destination and outside everything is flashing by so you can't see anything.;;;;;;;;

2423;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;If I'm protecting someone, I won't let her die, and if I'm attacking, I'll cut you.;;;;;;;;
2424;(One Piece);Sanji;Don't start a fight if you can't end it.;;;;;;;;
2425;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;I'll do what I want till the end. Cut me down if you want.;;;;;;;;
2426;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;I like myself. I have never once hated myself. My high specs, my half-decent looks, my pessimistic, realist point of view... I don't hate any of it at all.;;;;;;;;
2427;(Love Live! School idol project);Eli Ayase;I'm saying that practically nobody feels that they're talented. That's what makes us strive to improve. As we strive to improve, we notice the people around us improving too, which makes us work even harder. I guess you could say friends are like rivals, in a way.;;;;;;;;
2428;(Love Live! School idol project);Nozomi Tōjō;Why don't you give it a try? You don't need to come up with a reason, you try things because you want to. Isn't that how you start doing things that you really like?;;;;;;;;
2429;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;Tears and rain, fall down on my face, my body is unable to stay yet my heart is unwilling to leave.;;;;;;;;

2432;(Kuroko No Basket);Kuroko No Basket;* The Zone * In this state of extreme focus, all unnecessary thoughts disappear and the athlete becomes absorbed in his play. Only those who have practiced and practiced earn the right to stand before the door, and it only opens unpredictably. It is the ultimate domain, open only to the chosen.;;;;;;;;
2433;(CLANNAD);Sakagami Tomoyo;I've already decided. Getting good grades and listening to teachers can take me somewhere high and far away, but what if that's not where I want to go? Right here, by your side, Tomoya, is the only place I want to be.;;;;;;;;
2434;(Love Live! School idol project);Nico Yazawa;Listen, an idol's job isn't to show people their smiles, it is to make people smile. Never forget that!;;;;;;;;

2439;(CLANNAD);Sunohara Youhei;You're trying to stay unscarred, aren't you? If you've come this far, you'll have to hurt someone. The more time you take to decide, the deeper and more it'll hurt. For all of you.;;;;;;;;
2440;(Clannad After Story);Okazaki Tomoya;The days I spent with you were a lot of fun. I realized for the first time that it makes me so happy to be needed by others. I thought I'd get along well with you like this. But I can't. I was being a jerk. While I was with you, I was looking at someone else. I kept it to myself even after realizing that. I was taking advantage of your kindness.;;;;;;;;
2441;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;I will fight for my friends than watching them get hurt, I will fight for those I love.;;;;;;;;

2448;(Pandora Hearts);Lacie Baskerville;I despise common sense. I’ve seen the world from every possible angle. This cruel, ridiculous, beautiful world.;;;;;;;;
2449;(Chihayafuru);Hidehiro Harada;Some people think the act of investing efforts, trying your best is more precious than the result. But for mentors as well as their pupils, that approach feels bitter. 'I did my best', 'the fight was close'... words like that blow past and die out like a wind. Only the result is a stone. The stone you can reach by doing your best.;;;;;;;;
2450;(Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de);Kanzaki Tomoyo;Where will we be in five or ten years from now? No one knows. All we know right now, all we can see right now, is what's right in front of us. That's why we'll always live our 'right now' to the fullest!;;;;;;;;
2451;(Kids on the Slope);Kaoru Nishimi;Sometimes life is like jazz, and goes in an unexpected direction...;;;;;;;;

2456;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Kaworu Nagisa;Humans cannot create anything out of nothingness. Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding onto something. After all, humans are not gods.;;;;;;;;
2457;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I've been around longer than you have, kid. And I've seen my share of troubles. You're not the only one who knows what it's like to lose somebody. It looks like neither of us has led a charming life, have we? Still, it's not that bad. At least you and I have been lucky enough to find new comrades to help fill the void.;;;;;;;;
2458;(.hack//Liminality);Tohno Kyouko;Every society places the world in order, by the concept of opposites: inside and outside, religious and secular, celestial and worldly. The opposing concepts organize the world as it is today, but none of those can be distinctly separated. There is always a grey area where it is ambiguous.;;;;;;;;
2459;(Kuroko No Basket);Akashi Seijuurou;We cannot be satisfied until we have eliminated all others. It has nothing to do with reason. It is instinct.;;;;;;;;
2460;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Reinhard von Lohengramm;For those who have come to power, wealth and glory not by their own strength and effort, but simply through inheritance, what right do they have to complain? The very existence of such blood-lineage dynasties is disgusting. Power is the property of one generation. It shouldn't be transferred, it should be seized.;;;;;;;;
2461;(Detective Conan);Detective Conan;If you plan to continue being a detective and using words to entrap people, inscribe this in your hearts: Words are like knives. When used incorrectly, they turn into foul weapons. You have to understand the opponent’s heart and use them with discretion. No matter who it is you’re dealing with.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2464;(Ghost in the Shell);Motoko Kusanagi;There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind, like all the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality. Sure, I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it. I collect information to use in my own way. All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.;;;;;;;;
2465;(Ghost in the Shell);Hideo Kuze;Just as water runs downhill, the human heart also tends to revert to its basest instincts.;;;;;;;;
2466;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;No matter how many more points you have at the end of the game, if you're not happy, that's not a victory.;;;;;;;;
2467;(Psycho-Pass);Kouzaburou Touma;There's a limit to the amount of pleasure a person can obtain. But pleasure brought out by intellect is infinite.;;;;;;;;
2468;(Shinsekai Yori);Shun Aonuma;All problems come from the human mind. In the mind, one's consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg. What lies beneath the surface... the subconscious... is far more vast.;;;;;;;;
2469;(Brynhildr in the Darkness);Takatori Kotori;Is it so strange to do something for someone else? If the people I love can stay smiling tomorrow... then you can call me foolish or whatever you want.;;;;;;;;
2470;(Brynhildr in the Darkness);Tokou Nanami;People don't vanish from this world the moment they die. Their true death is when they are forgotten by the living.;;;;;;;;
2471;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;Don't break anyone's heart, they only have one. Break their bones, they have 206.;;;;;;;;
2472;(Sword Art Online);Keiko Ayano;It's impossible to work hard for something you don't enjoy.;;;;;;;;
2473;(Trigun);Meryl Stryfe;But you're wrong, no one ever has the right to take the life of another person. No one, no one ever has the right to take the life of another. No one. And everyone, everyone deserves a future. Don't you think that's true? Please, please, it's time to stop the fighting now. It's up to us to end the cycle of hatred. If we don't work to end the sorrow this time, then the cycle of pain will just continue on. When we were all born, were any of us made to steal or cause others harm?;;;;;;;;
2474;(Monster);Rosso;Killing's easier than you think;;;;;;;;
2475;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;People's feelings sometimes go astray and lead to irreversible consequences. ;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
2480;(Detective Conan);Ran Mouri;When people make a mistake, it is nice to give them advice, but... if they don’t listen, just leave them alone. Otherwise you'll do yourself a disservice by wasting your time and effort.;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
2483;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;Laziness is the mother of all bad habits. But ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her.;;;;;;;;
2484;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;The concept of lateness being evil is wrong in the first place... The police don't mobilize until after an accident happens, and it's standard for heroes to show up late. But would anyone condemn them for being late? So, speaking paradoxically, lateness is justice. ;;;;;;;;
2485;(Tokyo Ghoul);Ayato Kirishima;The world runs on power. Everything is determined by the superior power. You are weak. That is why you lose.;;;;;;;;
2486;(Shinsekai Yori);Maria Akitsuki;I think there are many things in this world we are better off not knowing. Sometimes the truth is the cruelest thing of all. Not everyone can bear it.;;;;;;;;

2491;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Shinobu Oshino;It's not good to expect too much, but you can't do anything if you're being overly pessimistic. If you just wait thinking it's useless, nothing will come of it.;;;;;;;;
2492;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;People’s feelings sometimes go astray and lead to irreversible consequences. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2494;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Humans are easily tempted. When they are poised on the edge of hellish despair, and a spider-thin thread of salvation presents itself, they will invariably grasp it. No matter the human.;;;;;;;;
2495;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;Words are like swords. If you use them the wrong way, they can turn into ugly weapons.;;;;;;;;
2496;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Edward Elric;The cycle of life goes only one direction, not even alchemy can change that.;;;;;;;;
2497;(Hajime no Ippo - Champion Road);Takamura Mamoru;"For a man to stand up again, he needs one thing... ""To make excuses"".";;;;;;;;
2498;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Kaworu Nagisa;Are you afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance you avoid a betrayal of your trust, but you must endure the loneliness. Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone.

2533;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;What value does your will have? I asked you what price it carries. If money is enough, is your will for sale?

2565;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;You know, I discovered something. Everyone has something... Something deep inside their hearts. For some, it might have been enmity. For others, admiration. Wishes, a craving for the spotlight, feelings that one wants to deliver, feelings for one's mother. Everyone was supported by their own feelings. I realize now that, perhaps, no one can stand alone on stage.;;;;;;;;
2566;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;By exchanging notes, you get to know one another, to understand one another. As if your souls were connected and your hearts were overlapping.

2568;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Hiroko Seto;Defiance toward parents is an establishment of one's self;;;;;;;;

2591;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;The more I concentrate, the more I get consumed by my performance. The sounds I play fade away from my reach, tangling up like flowers seized by the spring wind and vanish.;;;;;;;;
2592;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, evil for evil.;;;;;;;;
2593;(Devil Survivor 2);Yamato Hotsuin;The notion of set fate is ridiculous. Cause and effect can be bent through strength.;;;;;;;;
2594;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;I have to accept that who I want to become and who I can actually become are different.;;;;;;;;
2595;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;I always wished to be accepted by my surroundings. I tried to change myself for that reason. But, I don't care if I'm disliked. I don't care if I don't have a place where I belong. I don't mind if everybody rejects me starting tomorrow. I will even become a devil for the person who is trying to protect me.;;;;;;;;

2632;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;Ever since I was little, I've always been curious. Why doesn't the witch, who can use her magic to transform a shabby girl into someone lovely, cast a spell on herself? If she used her magic on herself, she could become lovely too. The witch does not use her magic on herself because she knows the emptiness that follows when the spell breaks.;;;;;;;;

2655;(Berserk);Berserk;Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives meaning to his life.

2656;(Berserk);Griffith;While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart in their wake. Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.;;;;;;;;
2657;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Legend of the Galactic Heroes;Humans always pursue things they can’t reach. Doesn’t it single-heartedly symbolize such yearnings?;;;;;;;;
2658;(Akuma To Love Song);Kawai Maria;Friendship might begin with getting picked, but I don't think that you can stop picking for yourself either. But in order to choose, there are things you need to know. And in order to get picked, you need them to know certain things.;;;;;;;;

2663;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Oskar von Reuenthal;Regardless of the color of eyes or skin, the color of blood is the same for everyone, isn’t it?;;;;;;;;
2664;(Akuma To Love Song);Yuusuke Kanda;To me, Kawai-san is like a mirror. A mirror that reflects all the bad parts about you. A devil-like mirror that contaminates your heart.;;;;;;;;
2665;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kousei Arima;But I wasn't slacking at all. I practiced till I passed out. I gave my all. And if I still turned in a sloppy performance after all that, then... That's who I am now. It's the current me, playing with everything I've got.;;;;;;;;
2666;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Everybody has to display a certain loyalty to their paycheck. I was the same way. It isn’t just a piece of paper, but a chain that binds people.;;;;;;;;
2667;(CLANNAD);Furukawa Nagisa;If you can move on, then you should.;;;;;;;;
2668;(CLANNAD);Furukawa Nagisa;Nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things… Happy things… They can’t possibly remain the same.;;;;;;;;
2669;(CLANNAD);Ichinose Kotomi;The day before yesterday, I saw a rabbit. Yesterday, it was a deer. And today, it’s you.;;;;;;;;
2670;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;Humans can’t reverse the flow of time. If you try to twist it against its will… You’ll be punished.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2672;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;Humans live behind masks. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2676;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Jin Mitaka;You need to decide where you belong before anything else. If you can do that, you can decide what you want to do.;;;;;;;;
2677;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;Neither terrorism nor occultism have ever impacted history in any constructive way.;;;;;;;;
2678;(Persona 3);Pharos;Time brings an end to all things. Even if we plug our ears and cover our eyes. ;;;;;;;;
2679;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Yang Wenli;In the long flow of time, living things know nothing of their ancestors, except for the genes they’ve inherited. Only mankind has history. Having a history differentiates mankind from all other living species. That’s why I wanted to be a historian.;;;;;;;;
2680;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Reinhard von Lohengramm;Perfection is a fairly nonexistent thing. If you couldn’t do it, it was probably impossible for anybody else, too.;;;;;;;;
2681;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Olivier Poplan;One cannot live by jokes alone. But if there were no jokes, I’d rather not live.;;;;;;;;
2682;(Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de);Himeki Chifuyu;Listen up, Cookie. Summer break is a break. We forget about homework. That's common sense. Understand?;;;;;;;;
2683;(Hanayamata);Hana N. Fontainestand;"See, ""empty"" just means you have plenty of room to take in all kinds of new things. Fun things, precious things, painful things, things you've never seen before!";;;;;;;;
2684;(Jormungand);Jonathan Mar;There are so many weapons scattered across my path that it makes me wonder if this world is made of little more than lead and gunpowder.;;;;;;;;
2685;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;<About Ciel> He turns his back towards the light without hesitation. That figure that charges into the abyss at a dignified pace. How beautiful and foolish.;;;;;;;;
2686;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;Put a steel mask on your face and armor on your heart.;;;;;;;;
2687;(Hamatora: The Animation);Birthday;I just think we're missing out if we're not trying different things and having fun. Life's too short.;;;;;;;;
2688;(Oyasumi Punpun);Punpun Onodera;I always believed that everyone in this world was far nicer and smarter than me. That no matter how unlikeable they seemed to be, they still had a good conscience and had justifiable circumstances for acting the way they did. That’s why I hated myself for being so timid and depressed when I didn’t even have any good reason for doing so. …But now I see that there actually are people who’re despicable in every way and don’t blink twice at ruining another’s life. Now that I think about it, it’s almost strange. Why don’t most people try to kill other people? How can they just stand by and let the scum have their way without the slightest indifference? Maybe my expectations were too high. I’m only disappointed because I expected something from them. But the answer was quite simple all along. There’s no such thing as a decent human being in this world. Not a single one. I did what I had to do. And I feel quite refreshed after doing it. That’s why I can say that this world could afford to be a little more chaotic.;;;;;;;;
2689;(Sword Art Online II);Konno Yuuki;I always say what exactly what I'm feeling, and if they don't like me, that's fine! It doesn't change the fact that I was close to their hearts.;;;;;;;;
2690;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;It's better to be hurt than to hurt others. Nice people can be happy with just that.;;;;;;;;
2691;(Solanin);Meiko Inoue;I never knew that spending an entire day doing nothing could be so terrifying. A plague of what-ifs assaults me, spinning and whirling, even though thinking about them makes no difference.;;;;;;;;
2692;(Revolutionary Girl Utena);Juri Arisugawa;There is only one person who you can each truly love. It’s too bad that you can’t change who that person is. If you could, the you both would be a lot happier.;;;;;;;;
2693;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Humans must think about living on. And, must also understand death. Most important, we must learn to understand the truth.;;;;;;;;
2694;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Instead of regretting what we cannot do, it is better to do what one can. Even for example, what you do has nothing to do with results, you must forge forward.;;;;;;;;
2695;(Princess Tutu);Rue Kuroha;The depths of despair…. I feel so calm here. I won’t be tricked by anyone anymore, and I don’t have to resent anyone. There’s nothing here. Not even loving. Nothing but to keep dancing until I die away.;;;;;;;;
2696;(Oyasumi Punpun);Oyasumi Punpun;Although Punpun didn’t really want to think about what the point of having dreams that could never come true was… To have dreams and worries that you could talk frankly about… In a way, that was probably a more fulfilling lifestyle than his own, Punpun admitted. Being cool was merely a paper-thin difference away from being empty.;;;;;;;;
2697;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;The main reason I got stronger was so I’d be able to survive.;;;;;;;;
2698;(Super Dangan Ronpa 2);Chiaki Nanami;Believe in yourself... If you don’t have that... it doesn’t matter how many talents you have, you still won’t be able to hold your head up high...;;;;;;;;
2699;(Psycho-Pass 2);Sakuya Tougane;My will is society's will. My eyes are society's eyes. Since you vowed to respect the law, you cannot deny me... no matter how much you despise latent criminals.;;;;;;;;
2700;(Psycho-Pass 2);Jouji Saiga;If the being casting judgment is perfect, then it has to judge itself as well.;;;;;;;;
2701;(Samurai Champloo);Monk Zuikou;Freedom, isn’t something earned through suffering or pushing yourself. You must accept yourself just as you are and live according to the flow of things;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2703;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;If comrades that you trust gather around you, hope can take physical form and become visible. That`s what I believe...;;;;;;;;
2704;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;Even if you're made a fool of by someone, even if the future becomes so dark that you can't see what's in front of you, even if the place we get to is the very end of the world, you and I are still together.;;;;;;;;
2705;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;Why shouldn't you quit, if that's what you really want to do? Everything will work out somehow.;;;;;;;;
2706;(Solanin);Ai Kotani;Nothing will progress while you can't make up your mind.;;;;;;;;
2707;(Solanin);Ai Kotani;You know why people stress over things? Because there aren't any easy answers.;;;;;;;;
2708;(Solanin);Ai Kotani;It'll still feel better to try and regret, than regret not trying at all.;;;;;;;;
2709;(Solanin);Ritsuko Ayukawa;I realized it one day. The lyrics I struggled to create are only made up so I would have something to sing. Nothing genuine can come out of these flat and boring and ambiguous lives we're living, out of faking your worries for the sake of it.;;;;;;;;
2710;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;Yeah, it might be totally stupid, but it's sad that you can't know yourself without being compared to others.;;;;;;;;
2711;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;Yeah, I know there's no right answer. All I know for sure is that time keeps on flowing like a river, and a river eventually leads to the ocean. Maybe I will try swimming against the current.;;;;;;;;
2712;(Solanin);Ai Kotani;No matter how well you get along together, sometimes the smallest of cracks turn into a lethal abyss in time.;;;;;;;;
2713;(Solanin);Naruo Taneda;We've got no light of hope in our future! Nothing is going to happen! Our lives will be as dull as rocks! Maybe it's a life of boring happiness! But I don't want to be an adult who pretends to be satisfied with it!;;;;;;;;
2714;(Solanin);Kato Kenichi;When you lose something, you gotta find something to take its place. I guess it's just time... for me to move forward for once.;;;;;;;;
2715;(Solanin);Kato Kenichi;Once you see a guy ignore the light in order to cross the street, you just can't stand still.;;;;;;;;
2716;(Solanin);Jirō Yamada;Why did I fall in love with music in the first place?;;;;;;;;
2717;(Solanin);Jirō Yamada;A band isn't so simple... that you can just mess around and keep it going.;;;;;;;;
2718;(Solanin);Saeki Ryutaro;I might seem to be on the losing side to you, but I'm still fighting... Not all battles happen in the brightest, flashiest spots.;;;;;;;;
2719;(Solanin);Ai Kotani;This town is overflowing with people, and each has their own worries, big or small... How many of them can truly say that they're happy?;;;;;;;;
2720;(Tokyo Ghoul);Kaneki Ken;I'm begging you, don't make me a killer!;;;;;;;;
2721;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Luciano Bradley;Do you know the truth of the battlefield? Kill a man normally, and it's considered a crime. But kill many on the battlefield and you become a hero!;;;;;;;;
2722;(World Trigger);Yugo Kuga;Know how strong you are... and do what you can do. If you misjudge your abilities on the battlefield... you'll get yourself killed.;;;;;;;;
2723;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Yukino Yukinoshita;People aren't all perfect. They're weak, ugly, and they get jealous and try to bring others down. Oddly enough, the better you are, the harder it is to live. That's why I'm going to change this world and the people in it...;;;;;;;;
2724;(Nanatsu no Taizai);Merlin;When some things contradict each other, you should look at the opposite side of everything. And when the meanings behind the seemingly unnatural actions are made clear, a completely different answer might be reached... Justice can become evil. Reality can become an illusion. Meaning can be found in something that appears meaningless. Think. And find the answer for yourselves. A human ceases to be once he or she stops thinking. ;;;;;;;;
2725;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Yukino Yukinoshita;I think, if you want to improve yourself, you should challenge your own limits.;;;;;;;;
2726;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;It’s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.;;;;;;;;
2727;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Bismarck Waldstein;War is merely one method of diplomacy. However, it is the least efficient one.;;;;;;;;
2728;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Charles Zi Britannia;Only fools wage war.;;;;;;;;
2729;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Shirley Fenette;Lelou? I'm glad that I could talk to you in the end. You know? When I got my memories back, I was so scared... A fake teacher... Friends with no memories... Everyone was... lying to me... It was as if... the whole world was watching over me... Lelou, you've been fighting... all by yourself against this world... All by yourself... So that's why... I wanted to become the one thing truthful to you... I love you, Lelou. Even when I knew you killed my father... I couldn't... bring myself to hate you. Even when you tried to make me forget everything... I still fell... in love with you again... Even when my memories were altered... I still fell in love again... No matter how many times I'm reborn... I'm sure I'll... fall in love with you again, Lelou... This... is fate, right? So, it's okay, right, Lelou? That I fall in love with you when I'm reborn... No matter... how many times... I'll... fall in... love with you...;;;;;;;;
2730;(Black Bullet);Satomi Rentarou;The scariest thing about killing people is getting used to it! When you kill someone and realize you won't be punished... That's when people forget all about punishment!;;;;;;;;
2731;(No Game No Life);Sora;Throughout all of history, no wise king has ever forced his army to obey him through oppression. People will only truly fight for what is right. And there is only one thing that is truly right in this world! The one true, unchanging righteousness in the world is... cuteness! Cute makes right! All our needs, desires, and instincts seek cuteness, and it is for cuteness that we will give everything we have! That's just the way men are!;;;;;;;;
2732;(Akame ga KILL!);Bulat;You'll have some painful, despair-ridden experiences. In fact, most of them will be tragic. But we chose to walk this path. We'll take on the dirty work. And change the world. After we finish, we can disappear.;;;;;;;;
2733;(Akame ga KILL!);Wave;Protecting the powerless is simply a soldier's duty!;;;;;;;;
2734;(Psycho Love Comedy);Syamaya Saki;Everyone shows their true face on death's doorstep. Even a noble-minded gentlemen will cast away his principles to beg on the ground. Even a cordial and gentle lady will start cursing with a face like a demon's. Even a frivolous and humorous man will accept death without any punchlines... That is what I believe--The instant just prior to death is when all sorts of true natures will be revealed. Using fear and suffering leading straight to death, baring naked hearts to be admired at one's leisure... This is also one of the wonders of murder.;;;;;;;;
2735;(Psycho Love Comedy);Kamiya Kyousuke;Pull yourself up after falling and advance with resilience.;;;;;;;;
2736;(Psycho Love Comedy);Kamiya Kyousuke;Whether in a brawl or anything else, bones can be broken but the spirit must not yield. Once a decision was made, it must be upheld until the bitter end.;;;;;;;;
2737;(Psycho Love Comedy);Kamiya Kyousuke;Love is never without trials and tribulations--precisely because of that, there's bitterness. What do you think? The feelings from liking someone... cannot be satisfied by your own efforts alone. It's not the same as simple anger or sadness. One-sidedly declaring your feelings... this doesn't bring satisfaction. Only when the other person feels the same way... Only when two hearts love each other is fulfillment achieved.;;;;;;;;
2738;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Maou;I think that education will prove the most powerful force in this world.;;;;;;;;
2739;(Log Horizon);William Massachusetts;We lost. We got wiped out. We may be finished. Maybe it was all a waste. Like they always said... We're idiots who've wasted our time on something as pointless as games. Game junkies who never leave their houses. Vegetables. But who cares? We knew that all along. We knew it, and we do it anyway. But we love games. We chose this. And sometimes we'll win, and sometimes we'll lose. So what? We've dedicated our lives to it. So it's real!;;;;;;;;
2740;(Akatsuki no Yona);Hak Son;When you protect someone you want to keep safe, do you always weigh your own life against theirs?;;;;;;;;
2741;(Sword Art Online);Yui;Everyone smiles, when they are with you. Please... from now on, go and help people in my place. Share your happiness with them.;;;;;;;;
2742;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;You stole this world and it's people. You're a king of thieves, alone upon a stolen throne!;;;;;;;;
2743;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;If  you are lookin' back all the time, you'll never get ahead!;;;;;;;;
2744;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Maou;Do evil, get caught, then claim demons were brainwashing you. A common way that human politicians evade responsibility.;;;;;;;;
2745;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Maou;Keeping all the wealth for yourself may make your rich, but it won’t make you prosperous. You give people money, and they spend it. True prosperity comes from a free flow of wealth and goods.;;;;;;;;
2746;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Rika Suzuki;If people want to, they can become angels or demons themselves.;;;;;;;;
2747;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Rika Suzuki;There's no way of telling what people will do when their entire world gets turned upside down. There are people who selfishly take advantage  of the chaos and nice people who try to help others before even worrying about themselves.;;;;;;;;
2748;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Ashiya Shirou;Sometimes it's necessary to courageously retreat.;;;;;;;;
2749;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Chiho Sasaki;I fell for you out of my own free will. So if I ever fall out of love, that'll be my own decision too.;;;;;;;;
2750;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Emi Yusa;The peaceful world I'm fighting for is one where everyone has a smile on their face, not one where I have to pretend I didn't see you make my friend cry. I don't think that kind of peace is worth fighting for. And I don't think it's worth making sacrifices to achieve it.;;;;;;;;
2751;(Ghost in the Shell);Puppet Master;Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information. As a species of life that carries DNA as its memory system... man gains his individuality from the memories he carries. While memories may as well be the same as fantasy... it is by these memories that mankind exists.;;;;;;;;
2752;(Ghost in the Shell);Puppet Master;All things change in a dynamic environment. Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.;;;;;;;;
2753;(Ghost in the Shell);Puppet Master;And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?;;;;;;;;
2754;(Elfen Lied);Kurama;Regret is the domain of those who have earned the right to look back at the past. All I have is shame.;;;;;;;;
2755;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Kiyotaka Ishimaru;There is no greater accomplishment in life than pushing yourself to the limit, always! Isn’t that so? That’s all there is to it!;;;;;;;;
2756;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;The city is changing. Our surroundings, and even ourselves. And then one day, just about everything will change… ;;;;;;;;
2757;(CLANNAD);Fujibayashi Ryou;Please don’t apologize. If you did, and I forgave you, then it’d be like it was all a lie. I want to hold those memories we had dear. The fun times… The painful times… All of it. So please, don’t apologize.;;;;;;;;
2758;(CLANNAD);Sunohara Youhei;You’re the spore of a flower. You’ll be going on a trip, taken away by the wind. To go to new places and meet new people. You shouldn’t always rely on your sister. Even if you’re apart, your bonds still remain. That’s what family is. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2760;(CLANNAD);Sagara Misae;If you get all worked up yourself, you’ll always get someone who’ll rebel. Being too eager brings negative results.;;;;;;;;
2761;(CLANNAD);Yoshino Yūsuke;What’s important is not losing sight of your path. ;;;;;;;;
2762;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Yoshii Akihisa;Who’ll give up when it comes to such a mere setback? We haven’t lost yet! We’ll kneel on the floor and regret only after all possibilities are exhausted!;;;;;;;;
2763;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Yoshii Akihisa;People normally say that mood and body have a close relationship. As the heart becomes weaker, the body will fall ill;;;;;;;;
2764;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Yoshii Akihisa;Fear comes from within, and isn’t something that can be conquered psychologically in such a short while.;;;;;;;;
2765;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Sakamoto Yuuji;Nobody will be happy being told off for something they never did.;;;;;;;;
2766;(Akame ga KILL!);Mine;Only I can help myself, and in the future, I can make up for all my misfortunes and change the world into a place where there's no irrational discrimination and that's why there's no way in hell that I can die here!;;;;;;;;
2767;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;When you are experienced you can become overly confident and such confidence can prove fatal.;;;;;;;;
2768;(Log Horizon);Crusty;Living your life to the fullest 'til the moment of your death, this is the rule to live by in any world.;;;;;;;;
2769;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Diethard Ried;At times the life of a single man is worth more than that of a million, I thought that'd be common sense to a soldier.;;;;;;;;
2770;(Hunter X Hunter);Hisoka;Right now, I'm letting you live. And I'll continue to keep you alive... until you've grown enough to become worth killing.;;;;;;;;
2771;(Mushishi);Ginko;Between dreams and reality is the vault of your soul. No one could see the “Dream World” without this path.;;;;;;;;
2772;(Mushishi);Ginko;On this hand, imagine that these four fingers represent the animals, and the thumb represents plants. Then let's say people are here... On the tip of the middle finger, farthest from the heart.;;;;;;;;
2773;(Avatar: The Legend Of Korra);Iroh;Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.;;;;;;;;
2774;(Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai!);Satone Shichimiya;The moment you say a word of parting, you've already parted. So long as you and I are both somewhere in this world, we haven’t parted. So long as you don’t say it, you haven’t parted.;;;;;;;;
2775;(Kuroko No Basket);Akashi Seijuurou;What a laughable attempt. You should just stay where you are, groveling at my feet.;;;;;;;;
2776;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;I am the shadow that has overcome the light.;;;;;;;;
2777;(Hunter X Hunter);Meruem;Violence is the greatest power of the world!;;;;;;;;
2778;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;That’s right. I’m nice. After everything that has happened in my life, I still haven’t gone after anyone or anything in revenge. If I were normal I would have destroyed the world by now. In a sense it makes me a savior of sorts.;;;;;;;;
2779;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Knowing more means having more shit to deal with, you know.;;;;;;;;
2780;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;Loneliness is peaceful, but there'll be no one to share happiness with.;;;;;;;;
2781;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;This world is full of secrets meant never to be disturbed.;;;;;;;;
2782;(Black Rock Shooter);Mato Kuroi;This is my darkness. Nothing anyone says can console me.;;;;;;;;
2783;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;In this world, when you face forward, that's the future. When you look back, it's a memory. And if you clip a part of it out, that becomes a story.;;;;;;;;
2784;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;Being indebted to someone is nothing to be ashamed of. Not repaying that debt is.;;;;;;;;
2785;(Grisaia no Kajitsu);Yuuji Kazami;I was feeling down, but you distracted me by subjecting me to your selfish whims. There are times when selfishness can save a person.;;;;;;;;
2786;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Solf J. Kimblee;Good… death is chasing me. Ones who kill are also chased by death, always living alongside death… Jobs that risk one’s soul are truly beautiful! How rewarding… my battlefield!;;;;;;;;
2787;(Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete);Akiyama Sou;It's not that I'm not sure or anything. I actually don't want to think about it. It's not that I don't care about the future, but I'm mystified as to why I should have to be in a rush to narrow things down right this minute. It's not that I'm trying to escape from it, but I want a little more of what I have now, easy and... or rather, spending time having fun. That's kind of how I feel.;;;;;;;;
2788;(Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete);Sasaki Kaori;The closer you are to someone, the more you have to put things into words to get your feelings across.;;;;;;;;
2789;(Nisekoi);Maiko Shuu;Seeing them as the same is wrong. It's a touchy subject, but the weight of something you bear with your own power and with someone else's are different.;;;;;;;;
2790;(Nisekoi);Maiko Shuu;In the end, mustering the courage to confess is up to the people ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
"concerned.""";;;;;;;;;;;
2791;(Akame ga KILL!);Gensei;If a person continues killing, their heart changes into that of a demon without them even noticing.;;;;;;;;
2792;(Akame ga KILL!);Gensei;Old, young, man, woman,  a life is a life. Sinner or Saint it makes no difference at all.;;;;;;;;
2793;(Akame ga KILL!);Sheele;No matter how many good deeds you perform, your past sins cannot be erased.;;;;;;;;
2794;(Coppelion);No-Sense;The world is a dark place... because you have a gloomy look on your face.;;;;;;;;
2795;(Akame ga KILL!);Kurome;To kill the one you love... If someone else will do it anyway, I'd rather do it myself.;;;;;;;;
2796;(Hunter X Hunter);Killua Zoldyck;Nanika, will you forgive me for being a bad big brother?;;;;;;;;
2797;(Rurouni Kenshin);Nenji Kashiwazaki;Who falls for who depends completely on the person. If there are a hundred people, there are a hundred ways to love... There never is one absolute form of love.;;;;;;;;
2798;(Haikyuu!!);Shōyō Hinata;Once my stomach settles down... You better be prepared, 'cause we'll really give you something to cry about in the mat... ugh... ch... uughh...;;;;;;;;

2800;(Haikyuu!!);Yuu Nishinoya;I kept the ball in the air, it’s not your place to give up.;;;;;;;;
2801;(Fairy Tail);Mirajane Strauss;Magic is not meant to be used to kill people... but without power we can't even protect the ones we love...;;;;;;;;

2804;(Haikyuu!!);Kiyoko Shimizu;Little by little, what you’ve begun will naturally become important to you. What you need at the start is a little bit of curiosity.;;;;;;;;
2805;(Brynhildr in the Darkness);Mako Fujisaki;Lives are never of equal value. There is always a ranking order.;;;;;;;;
2806;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;You came without fear. Don't have any regrets, no matter what happens. This is the duel you wanted.;;;;;;;;
2807;(Durarara!!);Shizuo Heiwajima;You just went for my head, didn't you? You know you could kill someone by hitting a vital spot in their head, right? If you know this, then you were trying to kill me, right? So whatever I do next is what you deserve, right?;;;;;;;;
2808;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They're my friends.;;;;;;;;
2809;(Fairy Tail);Mavis Vermillion;They all grow up, the youths that are going to live in this era. Go forward, youths. Like a wind on a field. Your burning blood, sweat, and tears... are as beautiful as a parasol. Show no fear, youths.;;;;;;;;

See, if it’s someone else’s fault, then there’s nothing I, personally, can do about it. I want to think it’s all up to me. If that’s the case, then I can do something about the things that go wrong. Then I can always run and always fly.;;;;;;;;
2840;(Black Rock Shooter);Mato Kuroi;You’re wrong! None of that makes any sense! Grief and suffering isn’t something that can be taken away by dying in a fight! You have to resolve your problems by talking and explaining your points of view. Relying on others for it is wrong! ;;;;;;;;

2851;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);C.C.;People... humans are the being who look for happiness. What the Britannian boy, Lelouch, wanted to have was nothing but a small happiness. It's nothing special. At least at the root of his motives, there were only humble wishes that were simply natural to any human. Who could ever disclaim such dreams and such vows? Who could ever have the right to do that? However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness. ;;;;;;;;

2856;(Another);Reiko Mikami;But if that’s what you want to do, you might as well try. It’s just pathetic to give up on something before you even give it a shot. ;;;;;;;;

2974;(One Piece);Donquixote Rosinante;I'll die smiling! Because if you ever think of me in the future, I want you to remember me smiling.;;;;;;;;
2975;(Ore No Imouto Ga Konna Ni Kawaii Wake Ga Nai);Kousaka Kyousuke;Even if I know you'll reject me, even if I'm afraid you won't accept me, even if I know it will really hurt if you dump me - I still have to tell you how I feel!;;;;;;;;
2976;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Mizuki Hayama;After all, lying for someone's sake doesn't make it a lie.;;;;;;;;
2977;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Mizuki Hayama;No matter how much you treasure them, both people and things will die someday. The bonds, the feelings, the memories, the hearts, and the lives. There's nothing in this world that won't die. There's nothing that won't break. Happiness is nothing more than a fabrication;;;;;;;;
2978;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Amamiya Yuuko;A miracle never comes to those who seek it.;;;;;;;;
2979;(Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru);Kidou Eita;None of that will ever happen. I hate myself! But still, I have to keep these fantasies going! If I have a thousand of them, at least one of them might come true one day. If you stop fantasizing, you have no choice but to be crushed by reality.;;;;;;;;

2983;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Shizuka Hiratsuka;You should realize that there are people whose hearts break each time they see you hurt yourself. ;;;;;;;;
2984;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;I can't tell you that… You have to figure it out. Stand up and walk. Keep moving forward. You've got two good legs. So get up and use them. You're strong enough to make your own path.;;;;;;;;
2985;(Log Horizon);Rayneshia El-Arte Corwen;Adventurers are free. They are more free than we are. It's true that we may be weaker than they are. But that doesn't mean that, in our weakness, we can become aggressive. We don't have the right to take advantage of our weakness and use them as tools!;;;;;;;;
2986;(Monogatari Series: Second Season);Deishū Kaiki;Humans have a desire for truth or they have a desire to what they know is the truth. In other words, what the truth is exactly second to that. Be careful of what is the truth and what is lie. In other words, always doubt yourself. Harbor an inner devil as you read along... and I won't forget to add that by that point, you might have already fallen into my trap.;;;;;;;;
2987;(Blood-C);Saya Kisaragi;I make my own decisions, and see them to the very end. I had to find my resolve, so I could remain true to myself.;;;;;;;;
2988;(Hunter X Hunter);Ging Freecss;You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.;;;;;;;;
2989;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Kaori Miyazono;If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive.;;;;;;;;
2990;(Guilty Crown);Inori Yuzuriha;I’m fine with being a monster. I’m fine with having fake emotions. But I’ll protect Shu. Because I am me! Even if I’m just a fake… To me, I’m the only… real one! ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
2992;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;We are taught never to shed tears. For to shed tears means that the body has been defeated by emotion. And to us, this simple act of crying proves, without question, that the existence of emotion is nothing but a burden.;;;;;;;;
2993;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;I lost my pawns, my knight, my rook, my bishop, and even my queen. But, it's not checkmate, just yet.;;;;;;;;
2994;(Fairy Tail);Makarov Dreyar;Even if I can’t see you… Even if we are separated far apart from each other… I’ll always be watching after you. I’ll definitely watch over you forever…;;;;;;;;
2995;(Fairy Tail);Mavis Vermillion;In that case, you have nothing to fear. Mistakes aren’t made by locking your feelings away and holding back… They’re made while wearing your heart on your sleeve.;;;;;;;;
2996;(Haikyuu!!);Ukai Keishin;Because people don't have wings... We look for ways to fly.;;;;;;;;
2997;(Nanatsu no Taizai);Meliodas;Everyone has to die someday. But what they believed in will never fade away as long as someone protects it. Once you've resolved to take on those principles, no matter how much blood and tears you shed, you follow through with it! That's what it means to be a knight.;;;;;;;;
2998;(Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple);Shio Sakaki;Life isn't about what can and can not be done, it's about doing it or not doing it!;;;;;;;;
2999;(Fairy Tail);Makarov Dreyar;Listen up, brats! Today’s defeat is the seed for tomorrow’s victory! We’ll rise up and show them! We don’t know the meaning of giving up!;;;;;;;;
3000;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;Comrades are comrades because they help each other out. ;;;;;;;;
3001;(Eden of the East);Saki Morimi;Most people are irresponsible, changing their opinions easily based on unconfirmed information or convenient rumors.;;;;;;;;
3002;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;We have no choice but to accept the one and only life we're given, no matter how cruel and heartless it might be.;;;;;;;;
3003;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;There is no such thing as perfect in this world. That may sound cliche, but it’s the truth. The average person admires perfection and seeks to obtain it. But what’s the point of achieving perfection? There is none. Nothing. Not a single thing. I spit on perfection! If something is perfect, then there is nothing left. There is no room for imagination. No place left for that person to gain additional knowledge or abilities. Do you know what that means? For scientists such as us, perfection only brings despair. It is our job to create things more wonderful than anything before them, but never to obtain perfection. A scientist must be a person who finds ecstasy while suffering from that antinomy.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3006;(Fairy Tail);Happy;They are your words! This is your heart! Our desire to help our friends belongs to us!;;;;;;;;
3007;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;There were many times I felt on the verge of giving up… And many times when I met with big trouble, and met with some really tough opponents… But during that time, he would always be there. And so would everyone else from the guild. Crying together, laughing together, so many of these things. Well, a lot of things really did take place… I’m sure that’s the way it should be… I’m sure that everybody carries a certain burden of their own. But even then, everyone tries their best to keep moving forward. That’s what makes Fairy Tail what it is. I really joined the best guild ever.;;;;;;;;
3008;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;If someone here were hurt or lost their life because of me, I think I would also be in pain much like Loke. But, it’ll be all right. If everyone works together and unites in power, we can overcome any pinch ahead, right?;;;;;;;;
3009;(Mirai Nikki);Kurusu Keigo;Think of your shivers as excitement rather than fear. Cover the anxiety on your face with a smile.;;;;;;;;
3010;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;In life, it's better to assume that bad things will happen to you rather than good things. You can't look at someone else's success and assume that it will happen to you. There are a lot of people in the world, so it makes sense that one or two of them are going to be fortunate. But there's only one of you. Assuming that good fortune will come to you is no different than pointing a finger at a random person and predicting the same for them. But do you think that prediction would come true?;;;;;;;;
3011;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;"The important thing is to think of something nobody else is thinking of. ""Ignorance is a sin"" is not about knowledge - it's about wisdom.";;;;;;;;
3012;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;While it may be that ignorance is a sin, it's impossible to know everything.;;;;;;;;
3013;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;Stories are better when they have an ending, are they not?;;;;;;;;
3014;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;When the time comes, I may need to borrow your chest to cry upon. That's one promise I'll need from you.;;;;;;;;
3015;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;The world is indeed full of malice, but there are some pitfalls one can avoid as long as one knows of them- ignorance is a sin, after all.;;;;;;;;
3016;(Guilty Crown);Gai Tsutsugami;If you value your peaceful everyday life, protect it for yourself.;;;;;;;;
3017;(Guilty Crown);Tsugumi;When someone does something nice for you… shut up and accept it!;;;;;;;;
3018;(Ao no Exorcist);Rin Okumura;Life's a bitch, so if it's easy, you're doing it wrong.;;;;;;;;
3019;(Cowboy Bebop);Jet Black;You were always there for me, and that’s all I needed. Just you. For some reason, I didn't feel sad or broken up, it just didn't seem real. But slowly I realized it was real – that you were gone. And little by little, I slowly felt something inside me go numb.;;;;;;;;
3020;(JoJo's Bizarre Adventure);Funny Valentine;Suppose that you were sitting down at a table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3022;(Hellsing);Alucard;Look well at Integra’s “battle”, Police girl! Integra cut herself open, shed her own blood… and chose to fight for her life. Giving up kills people. When people reject giving up… they finally win the right to transcend humanity. “Never give up, even if it means death”… that is the pride and dignity of our ;;;;;;;;
master.;;;;;;;;;;;

3030;(Gantz);Gantz;Despair… It hides away propagates, expands, and finally explodes.;;;;;;;;
3031;(Gantz);Gantz;There comes a time when we can no longer tell the invaders from the invaded. That is what we call “War”.;;;;;;;;
3032;(Aria the Animation);Akari Mizunashi;Lots of things change with the flow of time. But there are things that never change. Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don’t change… Both are precious. Don’t you feel the same?;;;;;;;;
3033;(Aria the Animation);Grandma Akino;Isn’t it okay to consider sad or hard times as the seasoning that lets you enjoy life? You can change them inside yourself so that you can enjoy anything. It truly is a wonderful thing, living each day.;;;;;;;;
3034;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: The Different Story);Sakura Kyouko;I never wanted to save the world or make everyone happy. I never wanted to play God like that. If I could just save my family, and my friends… If I could just be a hero like that, I’d be happy.;;;;;;;;
3035;(Haikyuu!!);Ittetsu Takeda;Does losing prove that you are weak? Isn't losing difficult for all of you? A challenge where, after ending up on your hands and knees, you must see if you can stand up again? If you stay on your hands and knees, that proves that you are weak.;;;;;;;;
3036;(One Outs);Toua Tokuchi;When a human is victorious is when they're most vulnerable.;;;;;;;;
3037;(Okami-san And Her Seven Companions);Ryuuguu Otohime; A woman's jealousy is blacker than the oceans deepest chasm. You may all begin screaming now.;;;;;;;;
3038;(Trinity Blood);Abel Nightroad;This eternally cursed power. This extremely disgusting existence! May this wretched body help me protect the things most important to me now! This is the only power that makes atonement for my sins possible! Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust, Earth to Earth! Amen! ;;;;;;;;
3039;(Casshern Sins);Casshern;What people seek when the depths of despair and death are upon them, may be the silhouettes of the ones they love.;;;;;;;;
3040;(Shakugan no Shana III);Khamsin Nbh'w;For those who love another... To disobey, to rage, to curse, to fight, to kill... None of these disproves that love. A love that's too strong may even make those more likely.;;;;;;;;
3041;(Fate/stay night);Archer;I killed many people to act on my ideal. I killed so many that I stopped caring about innocent people and I saved a thousand times as many as I killed.;;;;;;;;
3042;(Fate/hollow ataraxia);Avenger;Was I not clear? Then lemme give you an example. Say that somewhere, there's this guy who's suffering the absolute worst fate in the world you could possibly think of. You get wind of this guy somehow and hearing what he's going through really upsets you. That would be meaningless sentimentality I'm talking about. This is a far-off, distant world we're talking about, one you shouldn't concern yourself with. So even if someone in this far-off world leads such a sad existence, it won't keep you from living every day with a smile on your face.;;;;;;;;
3043;(Fate/zero);Lancer;Do all of you really want... to win that badly? You all want the Grail that desperately?! You'd crush the only wish I have in my heart... do none of you feel any shame at all?! I won't forgive you... I? won't forgive ANY of you for this! All of you monsters who'd disregard a knight's honor for personal gain... let my blood taint your dreams! Let the Grail be cursed! Let the wish it grants bring disaster! And when you fall into the pits of hell... remember the rage of Diarmuid!;;;;;;;;

3046;(Fate/zero);Kaminski Natalia;If you cut a thread, and then tie it, the thickness will be different where you originally cut it, right? In that sense, it means irreversible change.;;;;;;;;
3047;(Hyouka);Oreki Houtarou;People remember their high school days as the high point of their lives. People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their time in high school;;;;;;;;
3048;(Hyouka);Satoshi Fukube;"People who are confident in themselves never talk about expectations. ""Expectation"" is a word rooted in giving up. It leaves you with no other choice. It makes it obvious that you're powerless.";;;;;;;;
3049;(Hyouka);Oreki Houtarou;The best way to tame a mystery is with another mystery.;;;;;;;;
3050;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Amamiya Yuuko;No matter how important a person is, some day you will lose them. No matter how much you desire it, eternity is one thing you will never possess. It’s the time you do spend with that person that’s important, so that you can meet your parting without regret.;;;;;;;;
3051;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;Even if I’m not perfect… Even if I’m not the ideal me… He says that I’m still my own person.;;;;;;;;
The point of life isn’t to be perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;
It’s to do want you want to do; to be who you want to be.;;;;;;;;;;
"That’s how I should be trying to live.""";;;;;;;;;;;
3052;(Oyasumi Punpun);Yuichi Onodera;But once you grow old, you become afraid of even losing things without any value.;;;;;;;;
3053;(Monster);Wolfgang Grimmer;Do you have any idea how terrible the things you did really mean? Do you understand what it means to destroy a human being's sense of good and evil? Can you even begin to comprehend what happens when you awaken the monster inside each us? People should know in their hearts that food tastes good. They should always look forward to having picnics and wonderful places on their weekends. They should think that beer tastes good after a hard day's work. People should know how they should feel, that they're suppose to grieve, from the bottom of their hearts when they have to bury their own child.;;;;;;;;
3054;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;Whether here or in the real world, you can cry when it hurts. There's no rule that you can't show feelings just because it's a game.;;;;;;;;
3055;(Sword Art Online);Akihiko Kayaba;In every world, once you die, you're gone. ;;;;;;;;
3056;(Sword Art Online);Asuna Yūki;When I began thinking of him as I fell asleep, I stopped having nightmares. I began to look forward to seeing him. For the first time since I arrived here, I was happy.;;;;;;;;

3061;(Ergo Proxy);Ergo Proxy;We are the sum of our memories. Erasing the memories edged in oneself is the same as loosing oneself.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3063;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Mashiro Shiina;This area feels weird, it's been throbbing hard since that time. When you told me not to go. When you held me so tight. It won't go away. Your voice is still in my ear. What happened to me? Is this... love?;;;;;;;;
3064;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;What is the point if those with the means and power do not fight?;;;;;;;;
3065;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Ymir;I too used to believe that the world would be a better place if I hadn’t been born. I was hated merely for the fact that I existed, and I died for the happiness of many people. But there was one thing I wished for with all my heart... If I’m ever given a second chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish.;;;;;;;;
3066;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Historia Reiss;Even if you have your reasons and there are things you can't tell me, no matter what, I'm on your side.;;;;;;;;
3067;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;I was, I am, and I remain a soldier, sworn to devote my heart and soul to the restoration of humankind! There is no greater glory than than dying for that belief!;;;;;;;;
3068;(CLANNAD);Furukawa Akio;We didn’t give up on our dreams! We changed our dreams into your dream! That’s what parents do! That’s what a family does!;;;;;;;;
3069;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;I hate this town. It’s too filled with memories I’d rather forget. I go to school every day, hang out with my friends, and then go home. There’s no place I’d rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change? Will that day ever come?;;;;;;;;
3070;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;Isn’t it fine as long as you find it? Isn’t it fine as long as you find the next fun and happy moments again?;;;;;;;;
3071;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;Even if I could redo the past, I must not take back what has already happened, because if I do that, everything would be a lie: those tears, that pain, those memories, that cold reality that hurts my heart, all of it. There were people who died in pain. There were people who risked their lives to save others. There were people who mourned for the deaths. But then, if everything were taken back and it did not happen, where would all of those go? The dead people would not come back. Reality cannot be overturned. To continue on remembering the pain and the weight… isn't that how lost things remain? People will eventually die and death itself is sad, but pain shouldn't be the only thing that remains. A death is painful, but it also leaves behind bright memories. As I am bound by these people's deaths… As I am protected by my memories of Kiritsugu... I believe memories become constraints and change the people living now... Even if... They are memories that will eventually be forgotten.;;;;;;;;
3072;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Maebara Ichirō;There are many kinds of fights in this world, but if you don't stick to the rules you won't win support from the people around you.;;;;;;;;
3073;(Code Geass: Boukoku No Akito);Gene Smilas;A skilled dictator is much more beneficial to humanity than a democracy of ignorant people.;;;;;;;;

3075;(Fairy Tail);Acnologia;I will acknowledge you as my enemy and destroy you.;;;;;;;;
3076;(Fairy Tail);Mard Geer;I particularly dislike this emotion you call ANGER. It makes me lose sight of myself, you know. Just thinking of what happens to me if I'm not MYSELF. Disgusts me to no end.;;;;;;;;
3077;(Major);Goro Shigeno;'Goodbye' is the word that I've come to hate the most.;;;;;;;;
3078;(Oyasumi Punpun);Harumi Shuntarou;"People change. And as the years go by, so do our environments. I think it’s alright for there not to be a ""proper"" way of living. But I do believe that instead of trying to be satisfied on just one answer and blocking out the rest, searching for more answers, despite the pain they may bring, is a much more honest way of living.";;;;;;;;
3079;(Monster);Wolfgang Grimmer;Everyone in this world carries around their own sins, and they never go away...but that doesn't change the fact that we do what we must.;;;;;;;;
3080;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Rika Shiguma;You don't like being lonely, but you're afraid of people expressing their affection towards you. You pretend not to notice. You run away. You brush it off. You cover up. You reject. You even lie to yourself, convincing yourself that no one has any feelings for you.;;;;;;;;
3081;(Aah! Megami-Sama);Celestin;The system created by the divine ones segregates every single person into his living assignment in the world, determines his roles and controls them...the melancholy voices of those born into this world have pierced the depths of my heart. I feel the need to do something for them without discriminating against anyone.;;;;;;;;
3082;(Guilty Crown);Shuichiro Keido;The double grief of a lost bliss is to recall its happy hour in pain.;;;;;;;;
3083;(KenIchi the Mightiest Disciple);Shio Sakaki;Well, everyone's unsure of their fighting abilities. When that happens, just train more! When you're afraid, just train! When something doesn't feel right, just train! When you don't believe in yourself anymore, just train! The only thing that won't betray you is your training.;;;;;;;;
3084;(Tough);Seiko Miyazawa;"Even the most noble of the sacrifices is based on ""self satisfaction"". Jesus Christ himself was crucified for the sake of his people for ""self satisfaction"". That's why you shouldn't expect anything in return when you help someone. Because the moment you expect something, your act would become worthless.";;;;;;;;
3085;(Fate/zero);Saber;Only brute warriors find glory in destruction!  ;;;;;;;;
3086;(Fate/zero);Rider;A king must live a life more vivid than any other and be figure for all to admire! The king is the one who collects the envy of all his heroes and stands as their guide! Therefore, the king is not alone! For his will equals that of all his followers combined!;;;;;;;;
3087;(Eyeshield 21);Taro Raimon;A miracle something like that won't come if you're waiting for it. A miracle is something you work for!;;;;;;;;

3090;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Is it really worth saving this sad and ugly world, when there is nothing left after it is saved? With all this death, cruelty and sadness, do you still want to become a hero?;;;;;;;;
3091;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;We're all the same. No one really remembers the day he was born. We all have to trust another's word on the matter. It doesn't matter if it's true or not. Just having a birthday makes one happy I think.;;;;;;;;
3092;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;He who forgives and acknowledges himself... that is what it truly means to be strong!;;;;;;;;
3093;(Mouryou No Hako);Akihiko Chuuzenji;Let us talk about the brain. The brain is said to be the place where our consciousness resides. As we speak, each of us possesses our own distinct consciousness. We are all experiencing reality through our own point of view. To each of us, reality unfolds as a unique story as a result of our consciousness. However, looking to the outside from this box called the self, reality is subjective. ;;;;;;;;

3096;(Touhai Densetsu Akagi: Yami Ni Maiorita Tensai);Akagi Shigeru;People who can see get to choose... if you want them to know you can see. To pretend to be able to see, even when you can't... Or to pretend that you can't see even when you can.;;;;;;;;
3097;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I am not so noble that I would stake my life for someone else. Nor am I so forgiving that I would sit by and allow someone to trample me. I am selfish... and self righteous human being! That's why! I... to clear my own shame... I used your power. Not for anyone else! But for myself!;;;;;;;;
3098;(Ookami Shoujo To Kuro Ouji);Ayumi Sanda;You don't get to choose who you fall for. The heart doesn't always work the way you want it to. You should just follow your feelings honestly. You'll be happier that way.;;;;;;;;

3101;(Oyasumi Punpun);Sachi Nanjou;Such shallow emotions evoked by simple and cheerful stories won't solve anything!

3103;(K Project);Saruhiko Fushimi;I hate people with a big heart. All they do is look down on you from above. They don’t give a damn about the petty struggles of the people serving under them. If that’s what it means to be a king, then that’s just sad and pathetic. ;;;;;;;;
3104;(K Project);Kuroh Yatogami;Not many can do the “right thing” when it counts. ;;;;;;;;

3106;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;As long as no one got hurt, it's all good. Who cares who saved who?;;;;;;;;
3107;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Mikoto Misaka;You don’t need a good reason to save a friend. If you want to save them, then save them. I know someone who kept saying those stupid things even when he was driven to the brink of death, and he really did save over 10,000 people in the end. And that idiot that saved so many people is trying to save someone today like always. I know I can’t stop him. No matter how much I don’t want him to do anything dangerous, seeing him off with a push to the back is the sign of a good woman!;;;;;;;;
3108;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;If you want to do something and have the power for it, then do it!;;;;;;;;
3109;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;I can only say that the human curiosity is something completely irrational.;;;;;;;;
3110;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;Those stars look like they're close to each other, but they're actually very far away, aren't they? It's like Kitamura-kun and I. The things you see aren't always real. How hard must I try in order to understand the unseen truth? ;;;;;;;;
3111;(Hunter X Hunter);Netero;Human potential for evolution is limitless.;;;;;;;;
3112;(Devil May Cry);Dante;There are people out there who would say there's nothing more important than love. But is love really that great? There are women, who because of love, get chased around by men. And there are men, who because of love, get killed by women. To put it down, for love to be so great, there's gotta be something else behind it that's even greater.;;;;;;;;
3113;(The Legend Of Zelda);Sheik; Time passes, people move. Like a river's flow, it never ends. A childish mind will turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear water's surface reflects growth. Now listen to the Serenade of water to reflect upon yourself.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3115;(Oyasumi Punpun);Sachi Nanjou;It's fine even if you're useless right now. As long as you keep looking towards the future, I'm sure a day will come when you'll find your worth.;;;;;;;;
3116;(Oyasumi Punpun);Sachi Nanjou;Even the hardest of things can shatter when one little crack appears.;;;;;;;;
3117;(Sword Art Online);Asuna Yūki;There is one thing I've learned here. To keep doing your best, up until the very end.;;;;;;;;
3118;(Kyoukai No Kanata);Mirai Kuriyama;Somewhere along the line, I had decided that I can't interact with others. That I have no choice but to be alone, but I've found a new reason to stay. It's because everyone is alone, senpai. Everyone is all alone.;;;;;;;;
3119;(Kyoukai No Kanata);Akihito Kanbara;Just as there is a light at night and darkness in the day, there will always be darkness in the world. At the same time, the world will never be engulfed by the darkness. In that mix of ambiguous colors, everything moves on: our fates determined...;;;;;;;;
3120;(Kyoukai No Kanata);Hiroomi Nase;A person can work for their ideals. But if you lose sight of those ideals, when things don't work out as you hoped, you'll never accomplish anything! You won't be able to protect yourself or those dear to you.;;;;;;;;
3121;(Kingdom Hearts);Sora;The heart may be weak and sometimes it may even give in, but I've learned that deep down, there's a light that never goes out! ;;;;;;;;
3122;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Kaoru Yamazaki;A drama has a progressive thought, an emotional climax and a resolution, but our lives aren't like that. All we get day after day, are a bunch of vague anxieties that are never really resolved.;;;;;;;;
3123;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Satou Tatsuhiro;If you don't see her, you won't fall in love. If you don't fall in love, you won't get hurt.;;;;;;;;
3124;(Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's);Jack Atlas;Stop trying to change things that can't be changed. The past is the past and you have to let it go and embrace the future.;;;;;;;;
3125;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;There's something that cannot be expressed in words: human emotion. Emotions of the heart can't be just tucked away in a closet. There's a way to know the emotions: look into the eyes. The gentleman lied to me when I trusted him, but the moment I looked into his eyes the angel of destiny began to unravel the truth. Just look into their eyes, there is only one truth.;;;;;;;;
3126;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Kyōko Kirigiri;A hint is one thing, but simply sharing the answer it leads to is dangerous.;;;;;;;;
3127;(Black Cat);Saya Minatsuki;A pistol’s job is what its handler chooses. If I don’t wanna shoot, then I won’t.;;;;;;;;
3128;(Bungaku Shoujo);Konoha Inoue;If there's an ugly truth, a beautiful truth must exist too. Stories aren't purely ugly. They're not purely tragic or sad either. There are tender things and beautiful things in there.;;;;;;;;
3129;(Bungaku Shoujo);Konoha Inoue;I believe that some truths should never be known.;;;;;;;;
3130;(Bungaku Shoujo);Amano Touko;What is true happiness? Everyone seeks the land of happiness as if they're on a pilgrimage. They try to walk there. Still, no matter who they are, at times they become tired. Stories exist for those times. If you open the covers, you'll encounter someone else's imagination. If you feel lonely on your own, try reading a book. Try to imagine what the author was thinking, what he wanted to say. Then you might be able to obtain something wonderful.;;;;;;;;
3131;(Oyasumi Punpun);Yuichi Onodera;I just don't understand the reason why humans continue living on all the while as our individual egos hurt each other...;;;;;;;;
3132;(Oyasumi Punpun);Aiko Tanaka;I wonder why it is, that people fall in love with others? I think that to seek out love even when you already have a nice family is being greedy. No matter how much you like another person, you can never be with that person forever... But I dislike that. I don't care if I have to throw away everything else. I just want you to look at me.;;;;;;;;
3133;(Oyasumi Punpun);Yuichi Onodera;True happiness only lasts for a brief time, so you better enjoy it while you can, right?;;;;;;;;
3134;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;The difference in ability... What about it? Do you think I should give up just because you're stronger than me?;;;;;;;;
3135;(Love Hina);Keisuke Urashima;Memories - they can sometimes become vague and foggy and there are times when they disappear altogether. Therefore, because there are many things I don't want to lose track of, I will record everything in here (his diary) for the sake of those moments that should not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;
3136;(Naruto);Haku;It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning.;;;;;;;;
3137;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;Don't believe in the you that believes in me and don't believe in the me that believes in you. Believe in the you that believes in yourself.;;;;;;;;
3138;(Bleach);Coyote Starrk;I want to become weak and if that's not possible, then I at least want to make friends that are as strong as me.;;;;;;;;
3139;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;If you give me wings, I will soar for you even if this whole land sinks down to the water. If you give me a sword, I will fight for you even if this whole sky shoots through with your light.;;;;;;;;
3140;(Bungaku Shoujo);Miu Asakura;I wanted to hurt you, make you suffer, and make sure that you'd never forget me.;;;;;;;;
3141;(Bungaku Shoujo);Miu Asakura;In my family;;;;;;;;
3142;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Don't underestimate me! I don't quit and I don't run! You can act tough all you want! You're not gonna scare me off! No way! I don't care if I DO get stuck as a Genin for the rest of my life! I'll still be Hokage someday!;;;;;;;;
3143;(Guilty Crown);Shū Ouma;The right to use my friends as a weapon, that is the sinful crown I shall adorn.;;;;;;;;
3144;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;No matter how colossal a power you obtain, no matter how gigantic an army you bring with you, I ain't scared. While you've abandoned a hundred, I've connected with a thousand. While you've destroyed a thousand, I've been helped by ten thousand. So what's an army of a few thousand? We have protected everything as just three people. We're the Yorozuya.;;;;;;;;
3145;(Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple);Natsu Tanimoto;People can be so mean, no matter what you've done for them they will believe the first cheap rumor they hear. In the end they only care about themselves. ;;;;;;;;
3146;(Oyasumi Punpun);Yuichi Onodera;What do you think are the most important things in life? Money, dreams, sympathy towards others... Yes, they're all important things as well... But the most important thing is responsibility for your own actions. ;;;;;;;;
3147;(Oyasumi Punpun);Sachi Nanjou;There're a lot of people who want to be in despair just so they can pity themselves... But I think it's a waste of time, that's all. After all, you're the one who wishes to be left alone and refuses to share your pain with anyone else.;;;;;;;;
3148;(Gundam 00);Aeolia Schenberg;I hate it when knowledge is misused by people who have lost sight of reality, due to biased perceptions and prejudices. It is the source of misunderstanding, ignorance and conflict. I want us to understand each other.;;;;;;;;
3149;(One Piece);Portgas D. Ace;Sometimes the blood rushes to my head and I feel like, if I run I'll lose something important.;;;;;;;;
3150;(Naruto Shippūden);Itachi Uchiha;In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony Shinobi's blessing. But because, I'm enlightened by my intelligence.;;;;;;;;
3151;(Final Fantasy VII);Zack Fair;Embrace your dreams. If you want to be a hero, you need to have dreams.;;;;;;;;
3152;(Devil Survivor 2);Alcor;If all things are in fact preordained, then why... why is humanity able to think for itself?;;;;;;;;
3153;(Berserk);Berserk;In this world is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of god hovering from above? Perhaps men have no control even over their own will.;;;;;;;;
3154;(Ao no Exorcist);Rin Okumura;You trusted me, so I'll trust you too. That's what being friends means, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;
3155;(Naruto Shippūden);Itachi Uchiha;Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation.;;;;;;;;
3156;(Naruto Shippūden);Pain;Learn to embrace the fear of feeling about what it's like to contemplate what it is to know true pain. Because when I had nothing and no one - I always had Pain.;;;;;;;;
3157;(Soul Eater);Asura;There's nothing unusual here… The appropriate one stands in the appropriate place after the inappropriate ones have collapsed to the ground, defeated. There is nothing unexpected or odd about it. Because this is reality. Not one shred of uncertainty exists here. Not even fear, of course…;;;;;;;;
3158;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;I don't want fear for a future, that may not even come, to stop me from acting today.;;;;;;;;
3159;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I'll never show you my tears. These are the tears of those who died with regrets. If there's a way to take away these regrets, I'll make sure I'll find it. If it's fear that you speak of, then I'll stand and face it. I'll never give up. The only time I lose is when I die!;;;;;;;;
3160;(Soul Eater);Asura;Sitting there in the dark, I had the chance to think about a lot of things, including the nature of the world itself. And after lengthy consideration, I realized something;;;;;;;;
3161;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;There is no inherent right or wrong in this world, those labels are just artificial constructs. Right and wrong are held by positions of authority. That is the way it's always been, so how then could anyone know this truth you speak of? Don't you see the reality is that truth long ago became nothing more than a shadow of itself;;;;;;;;
3162;(Aoi Bungaku Series);K;Those who do not want to advance spiritually are fools.;;;;;;;;
3163;(Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso);Watari Ryouta;It's only natural for the girl you're crushing on to be in love with someone else. Since you're in love with her, she sparkles in your eyes. That's why people fall so irrationally in love.;;;;;;;;
3164;(World Trigger);Osamu Mikumo;Rules make the world work. They don't protect you.;;;;;;;;
3165;(Parasyte -the maxim-);Migi;Upon researching the concept of demons, I believe that, among all life, humans are the closest thing to it.;;;;;;;;
3166;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Tsunayoshi Sawada;Be more confident despite your weaknesses and failures.;;;;;;;;
3167;(Gintama);Kagura;I choose my own battlefields. Not by my blood, but by my heart! I stand on the battlefield to protect what's important to me. And if anyone stands in my way, I don't care if it's one of my kind, my brother or anyone else… I'll crush them all!;;;;;;;;
3168;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Furude Rika;You can change fate as long as you believe you can.;;;;;;;;
3169;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Maebara Keiichi;If you just submit yourself to fate, then that's the end of it.;;;;;;;;
3170;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Everybody makes a wrong turn once in a while.;;;;;;;;
3171;(CLANNAD);Sakagami Tomoyo;No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside something warm and precious always remains, something that never changes. To me, that’s what family is like.;;;;;;;;
3172;(Guilty Crown);Mana Ouma;If you hurt someone, you must be prepared to receive the same amount in return.;;;;;;;;
3173;(Naruto Shippūden);Sasuke Uchiha;(About Sakura) Was she having fun in her little make-believe fantasy of true love? As for me, I have absolutely no reason to love her and likewise, I can see no reason why she would love me.;;;;;;;;
3174;(Umineko no Naku Koro ni);Featherine Augustus Aurora;The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it.;;;;;;;;
3175;(Kuroko No Basket);Teppei Kiyoshi;They say some defeats are meaningful and losing makes you stronger. Do you understand what that means? For living creatures victory is life, and defeat means death. It's an extreme example, but humans retain that instinct. Those who know the terror of defeat, hunger for victory.;;;;;;;;
3176;(Accel World);Haruyuki Arita;It’s natural to want to stay in the game world and hope the game will never end. However, I’ve learned one thing from playing all those online games. There’s nothing lonelier or sadder than the end of a game with no ending. More and more players get bored and move on to other games... And one day, even NPC's like your favorite blacksmith or landlady disappear forever as they smile. I've experienced that moment and cried many, many times. That isn't how games should end. It definitely isn't!;;;;;;;;
3177;(Denpa Kyoushi);Kagami Junichirou;The real fun is in constantly pushing beyond your limits. So if you're thinking of everything as a game, you won't be able to fully experience it.;;;;;;;;
3178;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Mikoto Misaka;I've only just started to understand it myself. That by depending on others, and letting them depend on you, people can exceed what they can do as individuals.;;;;;;;;
3179;(Guilty Crown);Yahiro Samukawa;People make a lot of mistakes, and strength is necessary to straighten those out.;;;;;;;;
3180;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;You’re too kind. Remember this and take it to heart: kindness sometimes leads to even greater tragedy.;;;;;;;;
3181;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Monokuma;"I came to realize something. Parenthesis are amazing! No matter how negative something sounds, if you throw ""LOL"" in some parentheses behind it - it becomes positive!";;;;;;;;
3182;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Don't just accept loss or defeat! Accept it after you're dead. If you lose without dying... it means that luck is on your side. If that happens - focus on surviving! Survive and Kill the one who couldn't kill YOU!;;;;;;;;
3183;(Tokyo Ghoul);Uta;If you like, you can stay over here tonight. If you're lucky, you may see some cannibalism and that's always fun...;;;;;;;;
3184;(Tokyo Ghoul);Uta;I  can neither live with you. Nor without you.;;;;;;;;
3185;(Naruto Shippūden);Madara Uchiha;The longer you live... The more you realize that reality is just made of pain, suffering and emptiness...;;;;;;;;
3186;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;If failure is the hallmark of being young, like they say. then someone who has failed to make friends must be at the peak of his youth, right? However, I'm sure they will disagree. All of this is just their double standards at play and nothing else. Here's the bottom line: Fools that enjoy their youth should go kill themselves.;;;;;;;;
3187;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;About marriage or about future, I don't know what will happen in the future. In this world, it's normal that when there's a preparation, then a new grief is born, but everyone has the right to desire happiness. Our efforts need to be held for the sake of our future.;;;;;;;;
3188;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Forcing yourself to like something you don't like brings sorrow.;;;;;;;;
3189;(Log Horizon);Nyanta;Any treasure you attain without anyone ever working for it is no treasure at all.;;;;;;;;
3190;(Mirai Nikki);Gasai Yuno;Everything in this world is just a game and we are merely the pawns.;;;;;;;;
3191;(The Breaker);Jin-Ie Kwon;When people get close to death they change.;;;;;;;;
3192;(The Breaker);Chun-Woo Han;In order to learn you may have to risk your life... no, even your soul.;;;;;;;;
3193;(The Breaker);Chun-Woo Han;Courage is the mindset of not surrendering even if you lack the strength.;;;;;;;;
3194;(Death Note);Ryuk;I didn’t choose you. Don’t you see this is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you’re so smart or something? Don’t be so vain. It just happened to fall around here and you just happen to pick it up, and that’s all there is to it.;;;;;;;;
3195;(Death Note);Light Yagami;Only I could do it! I was well aware that killing people is crime in itself! Yet at that point it was the only way to make things right! I thought to myself that someday people will come to realize this as much, and regard it as an act of justice! I had no choice but to act as Kira… it was the destiny given to me. I was chosen to renew this rotten world, to bring about true peace – a utopia.;;;;;;;;
3196;(Death Note);Light Yagami;This world is rotten and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world... can't go on like this. I wonder... what if someone else had picked up this notebook? Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it: there's no one, but I can do it. In fact, I'm the only one who can. I'll do it. Using the death note, I'll change the world.;;;;;;;;
3197;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Alis Color;Wishes shouldn't be granted. They're better off not coming true. When their wishes aren't granted, people actually put in effort. It's because they don't come true that people make progress. But if all their wishes come true, people won't be able to move forward anymore, you know?;;;;;;;;
3198;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Hampnie Hambart;Violence, greed, slaughter, corruption, defeat, failure, immorality, humiliation… These are everywhere. As long as you live, you will face them.;;;;;;;;
3199;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Hampnie Hambart;I do want to die. But I want to die happily. Like I have for others, I want someone to wave me off. My friends, my wife, and my children... Making them mourn for me, making them long for me, and leaving things that I should have done behind... That is how I want to die.;;;;;;;;
3200;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Mei Tachibana;Someday, maybe you’ll find someone like you to share your pain with. I can’t tell you when that will happen.... But the important thing is to not reject them.;;;;;;;;
3201;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Aiko Mutō;But there's nothing wrong about worrying. It's like a wall you need to overcome, to make it to the next level. If you're running up against that wall, it means you're moving forward. I wonder how many walls I've broken up until now, but if you won't move yourself, you will never get anywhere.;;;;;;;;
3202;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Yamato Kurosawa;In the end no one's going to protect you but yourself.;;;;;;;;
3203;(Toriko);Jiro;Life is like a playground swing, the higher and farther forward you go as you swing, it carries the risk of falling just as far back.;;;;;;;;
3204;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Mei Tachibana;When you trust someone and get to know them, you eventually learn about their wounds too.;;;;;;;;
3205;(Hunter X Hunter);Kurapika;A beast in human's clothing understands better than anyone how people want to be treated.;;;;;;;;
3206;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Mei Tachibana;I tried to carry on, while rejecting any relationships with others, but once you reject people, you're stuck. You lose the opportunity to meet someone and change.;;;;;;;;
3207;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Mei Tachibana;It’s like a doll house. You hang out together and pretend to be friends, but when it doesn’t suit them they abandon just you.;;;;;;;;
3208;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;If you haven't changed, that means you haven't improved.;;;;;;;;
3209;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;How did you learn of the reality that you speak of? The entire world is governed by the reasoning of dirty-minded adults. We're able to obscure reality according to our obsessions. We're never actually shown what reality is. In this case, the reality that you speak of is a half-baked nonsense that has been altered. Trying to conform this bullshit reality into the one you want is like trying to join two pieces of a puzzle that do not fit.;;;;;;;;
3210;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Working hard alone doesn't assure you that you'll achieve your dreams. Actually there are more cases where you don't. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.;;;;;;;;
3211;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Anime - it's not something that can be thought of in a hall for conferences. It is made out of strange juices current from the brain of animators.;;;;;;;;
3212;(Slam Dunk);Hanamichi Sakuragi;It's not too late to change ourselves and have a meaningful life.;;;;;;;;
3213;(Sword Art Online);Akihiko Kayaba;A person is very strong when he seeks to protect something.;;;;;;;;
3214;(Mirai Nikki);Amano Yukiteru;If there's a miracle that can be reached by fighting to the end, then I want to see it.;;;;;;;;
3215;(Mirai Nikki);Akise Aru;Not knowing everything in this world is fun.;;;;;;;;
3216;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;Become strong not just for your own sake, but for your friends.;;;;;;;;
3217;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Suzaku Kururugi;A victory won through dishonesty means it's no victory at all.;;;;;;;;
3218;(Tamako Market);Dera Mochimazzi;Even if your feelings or wishes do not come true, or if things don't go as you planned - on another road grows another flower. A new flower blooms there.;;;;;;;;
3219;(Rave Master);Deerhound;It doesn't matter what you achieve in life. It's how you live that really matters. Countless men have lost their lives in war without fulfilling their life's ambitions. Shiba stood by his convictions, no matter how lonely he got. So I think that in the end, he must've been happier than anyone.;;;;;;;;
3220;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Ryoji Kaji;If you know pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others.;;;;;;;;
3221;(One Outs);Toua Tokuchi;To take responsibility is to take the pain onto yourself. It means to bear more pain than what others felt because of your mistake. ;;;;;;;;
3222;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;People who grow up in different environments will invariably have different tastes and preferences. Therefore, could one say that the subsequent marriages necessarily lead to happiness?;;;;;;;;
3223;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;Though possessing two eyes, most creatures can see but a single thing at a time.;;;;;;;;
3224;(No Game No Life);Sora;An idiot that knows he's an idiot, is even harder to deal with than an idiot that thinks he isn't.;;;;;;;;
3225;(Shakugan no Shana);Margery Daw;Love is like a mirror that reflects your bad side. Especially when it’s unrequited, you get envious, jealous, prejudiced, and resentful. You have to face all sorts of emotions, but there’s no reason to find that shameful. It shows how serious you are. Oh yeah, do you want me to tell you how to break that mirror? It’s not anything hard, understand the other person. That’s all. Don’t make any quick judgment and let them do the same.;;;;;;;;
3226;(Little Busters!);Mio Nishizono;There are people in this world who don't understand that what they consider a harmless prank can deeply hurt someone else.;;;;;;;;
3227;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;Having someone saying you're okay as you are and being needed by that person... It was nice to have someone like that.;;;;;;;;
3228;(Kaze no Stigma);Kazuma Yagami;Death is the end of everything. Your past and future will be lost in an instant where there will be no second chance. However as long as you live there will be a chance of pulling a win.;;;;;;;;
3229;(Mirai Nikki);Akise Aru;If you want to know what others think, you first have to say what you think.;;;;;;;;
3230;(Naruto);Pain;Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist. There is no peace in this cursed world. War is just a crime paid for by the pain of the defeated...;;;;;;;;
3231;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Sonozaki Mion;I know everyone has their stories of pain and sadness or things that they don't want to bring up, but if you can't be a good friend without telling that, then I don't need any friends at all!;;;;;;;;
3232;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Mikoto Misaka;By depending on others and letting them depend on you, people can exceed what they can do as individuals.;;;;;;;;
3233;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Sorata Kanda;A normal person looks away from what they don't want to see even though they know there are things they can only acquire if they face the things they hate.;;;;;;;;
3234;(Akame ga KILL!);Tatsumi;The reason doesn't matter. As long as tiny bit of hope exists, that's all that matters.;;;;;;;;
3235;(Golden Time);Hayashida Nana;Once you miss the opportunity to say something, the words become increasingly toxic. The best thing to do is to just say everything.;;;;;;;;
3236;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;A farewell is like the other side of a coin. It will only happen when there is an encounter. Rather than dreading the day we have to part, shouldn't we be happy that we had the chance to meet today instead?;;;;;;;;
3237;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;You can die anytime, but living takes true courage.;;;;;;;;
3238;(Nanatsu no Taizai);Meliodas;No matter what lies you tell, you can't fool your own heart.;;;;;;;;
3239;(Spice and Wolf);Kraft Lawrence;There are many different ways to solve a problem. But once it's solved, we must live our lives. Which means we should choose not the simplest solution, but the one that will allow us to feel the most at peace once it's done.;;;;;;;;
3240;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;Even if it's small, take a step forward.;;;;;;;;
3241;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Change will never come about if you don't make it happen.;;;;;;;;
3242;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Accelerator;The second humans lose their comfort zone, the more simplistic their actions become.;;;;;;;;
3243;(Ao no Exorcist);Liu Cheng-Long;If you have memories no one else remembers, what's the point in remembering them?;;;;;;;;
3244;(Ao no Exorcist);Rin Okumura;Your past shouldn't stop you from achieving your goals and dreams.;;;;;;;;
3245;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;Let me teach you a thing. Normally the weak person's weakness is the strong person, but the strong person's weakness is also the weak person.;;;;;;;;
3246;(One Piece);Portgas D. Ace;Sometimes, the blood rushes to my head and I feel like, if I run, I'll lose something important.;;;;;;;;
3247;(Naruto);Ōnoki;Never give up without even trying. Do what you can, no matter how small the effect it may have!;;;;;;;;
3248;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;Once I'm dead, I won't even be able to remember you. So I'll win, no matter what. I'll live, no matter what!;;;;;;;;
3249;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Being hurt on the outside is better than being hurt on the inside.;;;;;;;;
3250;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;I'll admit that you're stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what's truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It's because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you'll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!;;;;;;;;
3251;(Deadman Wonderland);Shiro;The always naughty woodpecker. Today, too, you open holes and ruin the forest. The angry wood god turned your beak to poison. Poor woodpecker, your nest has been poisoned. Your food has been poisoned. If you touch your friends, they all die. The sad little woodpecker. Your tears of poison sparkle brightly...;;;;;;;;
3252;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;The ones who aren't able to acknowledge their own selves are bound to fail.;;;;;;;;
3253;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I understood that killing people was a crime. There was no other way! The world had to be fixed! A purpose given to me! Only I could do it. Who else could have done it, and come this far? Would they have kept going? The only one who can create a new world is me.;;;;;;;;
3254;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;People who continue to put their lives on the line to defend their faith become heroes and continue to exist on in legend.;;;;;;;;
3255;(CLANNAD);Yoshino Yūsuke;Everyone makes mistakes. What's important is how to make up for it.;;;;;;;;
3256;(One Piece);Dracule Mihawk;The world has too many heroes. It needs a monster.;;;;;;;;
3257;(Tokyo Ravens);Tsuchimikado Natsume;The truth is the truth, regardless of whether it comes out of a genius' mouth or a commoner's.;;;;;;;;
3258;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;"Marriage, the institution where one's existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying ""I'm home!"" to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say ""I'm home!"" if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say ""I'm home!"" to the hippos on the label. And if they're talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they're working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?";;;;;;;;
3259;(Naruto Shippūden);Madara Uchiha;It seems that you still want to dance but... You will not be able to make steps anymore.;;;;;;;;
3260;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;No one cared who I was until I put on a mask.;;;;;;;;
3261;(Naruto Shippūden);Madara Uchiha;I'd be lying if I said things are going according to my plan... but beggars can't be choosers, right?;;;;;;;;
3262;(Naruto Shippūden);Madara Uchiha;[Last words to Hashirama] As comrades, huh... well... if that's how... we... will.... *smiles*;;;;;;;;
3263;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;"....Would you consider dying together ""Teamwork"" as well?";;;;;;;;
3264;(Psycho-Pass);Nobuchika Ginoza;If you look away and just turn your back on those you don't understand, you'll regret it someday. Accept what's happening before your eyes as a fact. That's a shortcut to becoming an adult.;;;;;;;;
3265;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yoshida Haru;I don't understand you! You said you don't love me, but you act like you do! Then you tell me to stay away. Do I have a chance or not?!;;;;;;;;
3266;(Sukitte Ii Na Yo);Kai Takemura;Try relying on others once in a while. No one asks what's wrong without wanting to hear the answer. ;;;;;;;;
3267;(Nodame Cantabile);Chiaki Shinichi;No matter how painful, no matter how much solitary struggle awaits us, because we have joyous moments like this, we can face the challenges over and over again.;;;;;;;;
3268;(Busou Renkin);Papillon;A choice isn't something someone gives you, it's something you make for yourself.;;;;;;;;
3269;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;Whether you walk or run, the destination won't change. So then... You might as well run there!!!;;;;;;;;
3270;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;People's lives don't end when they die. It ends when they lose faith.;;;;;;;;
3271;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;The scariest and the most painful thing is to be hated by someone you truly love.;;;;;;;;
3272;(Itazura na Kiss);Naoki Irie;People's feelings can change. You may hate someone today, but you might come to love that person tomorrow.;;;;;;;;
3273;(Hentai Ouji To Warawanai Neko);Yokodera Youto;It's difficult to make a girl smile, even as a grown-up. But you should never, ever, make a girl cry. And if you ever see a girl crying, help her. You might not be able to make her smile, but they'll know how you feel.;;;;;;;;
3274;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Hampnie Hambart;The probability of you remaining yourself until the day you die is extremely low. The hopeless spark you have now will be corrupted and in the most awful way there is.;;;;;;;;
3275;(Log Horizon);Nyanta;Recklessness is the way of the young and tolerance is the beauty of adulthood.;;;;;;;;
3276;(Naruto);Choji Akamichi;You can steal the very last bite of my very best food. You can mock me all you want. But if you insult my best friend, I will obliterate you.;;;;;;;;
3277;(Naruto);Gaara;Three times now... We've fought world wars for our own nations, our own villages. We've hurt one another. We've hated one another. That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created ME. I was a Jinchuuriki, the embodiment of hatred and power. And I hated this world, and all the people in it... I wanted to destroy it with my own hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man, one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki... He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will! There are no enemies here because we've all suffered at Akatsuki's hand! SO THERE IS NO SAND, NO STONE, NO LEAF, NO MIST, NO CLOUD! THERE ARE ONLY SHINOBI! And if you still hold a grudge against the Sand, then when this war is over, come and take my head instead! Our enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want to protect our world! But I'm too young to protect it all on my own! All of you lend me your aid!;;;;;;;;
3278;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;Love requires no reason. That is what makes it love!;;;;;;;;
3279;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Tatsuya Shiba;I lost all of what you could call feelings of love. They weren't sealed, so they can't be released. They weren't broken, so they can't be fixed. That which is lost, cannot be recovered.;;;;;;;;
3280;(Haikyuu!!);Daichi Sawamura;Even if we're not confident that we'll win, even if others tell us we don't stand a chance, we must never tell ourselves that.;;;;;;;;
3281;(Log Horizon);Nyanta;Any kind of life can go wrong, or sicken or suffer. Lives get old, decay, and finally die. Disliking that fact because it hurts, isn't any different than disliking life itself.;;;;;;;;
3282;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Tatsuya Shiba;A world where everyone is equal and receives the same treatment. No such place exists. If there was a world of equality, where talent and aptitude didn't matter, we would all be equally snubbed there. ;;;;;;;;
3283;(Rosario Vampire);Mizore Shirayuki;Whether you're a monster or human there's no difference in the value of someone's life.;;;;;;;;
3284;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;If you're going to dig, dig to pierce the heavens. Even if it's my grave I'm digging, I'll keep going! When I break through, that means I've WON! Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Simon. I'm not my bro, Kamina. I'm ME! Simon the Digger!;;;;;;;;

3286;(One Piece);Brook;All for one, one for all! There are times when a man has no choice but to act!;;;;;;;;
3287;(Naruto);Gaara;Now there's something I understand a little better. Hate, sadness, even joy. To be able to share it with another person... Naruto Uzumaki. From fighting him I learned that. He knew pain like I did and then he taught me that you can change your path. I wish that one day I can be needed by someone. Not as a frightening weapon... But as the sand's Kazekage.;;;;;;;;
3288;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;I'll marry you! No matter what kind of sickness you have! Even if you can't walk or stand, or even when you can't have kids! I'll still marry you! No matter where or how I meet you, I'll fall in love with you. If I can meet you again, against the 6 billion to 1 odds, and even if your body can't move, I'll marry you.;;;;;;;;
3289;(Eureka Seven);Renton Thurston;Don't beg for it, earn it. Do it, and you'll be rewarded.;;;;;;;;
3290;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;I am who I am now because of my past. Calling any choice I made a mistake would be calling who I am now a mistake.;;;;;;;;
3291;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Jin Mitaka;You know, with talented people... They draw people to themselves, and without even trying to, they tear them to shreds. The closer you are to them, the more viciously you'll be torn apart. They're living in a completely different world above us. One that us normal people can't reach. In a world that we'll never see. A world above the clouds. That's the kind of world they live in.;;;;;;;;
3292;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Shinobu Nunotaba;A sin, once committed, is never forgotten. It haunts you for all eternity.;;;;;;;;
3293;(Log Horizon);Henrietta;They want to believe that's true and when someone wants to believe something is true, they usually will.;;;;;;;;
3294;(Pandora Hearts);Xerxes Break;Don't try to excuse yourself by saying you're doing it for someone else's sake. ;;;;;;;;
3295;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Tatsuya Shiba;No one's more aware of discrimination than the ones being discriminated against, huh?;;;;;;;;
3296;(Haikyuu!!);Ittetsu Takeda;Being weak means that there is a room to grow.;;;;;;;;
3297;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyōko Sakura;Hey God, if you're there, my life has really sucked. So please, for once, let me have a sweet dream.;;;;;;;;
3298;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;Even if I can't see. Even if I can't hear. I have light inside me. The path I walked with my friends, is bringing light to my future. I don't fear anything! This isn't even worthy of being called pain! The worst pain is.. The pain of losing your light.;;;;;;;;
3299;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Don't mistake borrowed power for your own ability!;;;;;;;;
3300;(Tokyo Ghoul);Rize Kamishiro;All of the disadvantage in this world stems from a person's lack of ability.;;;;;;;;
3301;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;Real pain is the result of losing someone you care about.;;;;;;;;
3302;(One Piece);Portgas D. Ace;Old man, everyone!! And you.. Luffy. Even though I've been good for nothing my whole life, even though I have the blood of a demon within me... You guys still loved me! Thank you so much!!;;;;;;;;
3303;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;If fate is a millstone, then we are the grist. There is nothing we can do. So I wish for strength. If I cannot protect them from the wheel, then give me a strong blade, and enough strength... to shatter fate.  ;;;;;;;;
3304;(Fairy Tail);Elfman Strauss;It's only the end if you give up!;;;;;;;;
3305;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;Maybe we can't help feeling scared alone! But we're all right here, together! We've got out friends close by!;;;;;;;;
Now there's nothing to fear;" because we are not alone!""";;;;;;;;;;
3306;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;We know our weakness. Now what will we do?;;;;;;;;
"We'll get stronger! We'll get up and fight!""";;;;;;;;;;;
3307;(No Game No Life);Sora;"""Checkmate"" doesn't mean you've simply cornered the enemy king. It's a declaration that the enemy king is yours. That's why I said it the first time I met you. ""Checkmate.""";;;;;;;;
3308;(No Game No Life);Sora;What kind of king makes his men fight at the front line while he sits behind them relaxing?;;;;;;;;
3309;(No Game No Life);Sora;"Huh? In a real war, what fool waits for their enemy's ""turn""?";;;;;;;;
3310;(No Game No Life);Sora;It's better for a man to be slow than fast. ;;;;;;;;
3311;(Log Horizon);Shiroe;Being strong on your own is meaningless. To have power you need other people, and they need a world where they can be at their best.;;;;;;;;
3312;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Ymir;Do you always want to live hiding behind the mask you put up for the sake of others?! You're you, and there's nothing wrong with that.;;;;;;;;
3313;(Log Horizon);Shiroe;If you can't do something, then don't. Focus on what you can do.;;;;;;;;
3314;(Aldnoah.Zero);Inaho Kaizuka;What does it take to end a war? Well, if both sides wish for peace and set aside their hatred... No. Warfare is nothing but a means of negotiation between states. Wars break out even when there is no hatred. Territory, resources, or interests that you are determined to own. Ideology, religion, pride. Wars are fought over those objectives all the time. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end. That, or the war will end when the human cost outweighs the gains. Anger and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor. I'm not interested in those emotions. So I wouldn't hate anyone just because they're Martian.;;;;;;;;
3315;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;If lives were lost today, then lives were also born. How important each day is... Depends on how important you feel it is to you.;;;;;;;;
3316;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;When there is evil in this world that justice cannot defeat, would you taint your hands with evil to defeat evil? Or would you remain steadfast and righteous even if it means surrendering to evil?;;;;;;;;
3317;(Log Horizon);Naotsugu;You're either an open pervert or a closet pervert!;;;;;;;;
3318;(Final Fantasy VII);Cloud Strife;I pity you. You just don't get it at all... there's not a thing I don't cherish!;;;;;;;;
3319;(One Piece);Smoker;Why did he smile? Why? Did he know he would be saved? No. In that instant, he must have understood that his life was going to end. Death. He accepted it. He was fully prepared for it and smiled.;;;;;;;;
3320;(One Piece);Donquixote Doflamingo;"I lost my mother when I was 8...and killed my father when I was 10.

Understood?";;;;;;;;
3321;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too. To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity.;;;;;;;;

3325;(Naruto);Might Guy;You're right, all efforts are pointless... If you don't believe in yourself.;;;;;;;;
3326;(Naruto);Gaara;If love is just a word, then why does it hurt so much if you realize it isn't there?;;;;;;;;
3327;(Naruto);Gaara;Family? Let me tell you what kind of link I have with them. They are just lumps of meat linked by hatred and murderous intent!;;;;;;;;
3328;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;I understand now. Even if I must take the devil's fruit, I must gain power. I am an avenger.;;;;;;;;
3329;(One Piece);Monkey D. Dragon;Someday, I promise you, they will all watch as I change the world.;;;;;;;;
3330;(One Piece);One Piece;Inherited will, the swelling of the changing times, and the dreams of people. These are things that cannot be stopped. As long as people seek the answer to freedom, these will never cease to be!;;;;;;;;
3331;(One Piece);Kuzan;"The thing called ""justice"" changes its shape... Depending on where you stand.";;;;;;;;
3332;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;To define true madness. What is it to be nothing else but mad?;;;;;;;;
3333;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;We don't have to know what tomorrow holds! That's why we can live for everything we're worth today!;;;;;;;;
3334;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;Everybody can fight. It's just a choice of whether you should.;;;;;;;;
3335;(No Game No Life);Sora;It's our job as normal people to ensure the potential of those misunderstood ones are realized.;;;;;;;;
3336;(One Piece);Whitebeard;"About Whitebeard ""Even in death, his body did not fall. His figure, taking down enemies while losing half of his head, was truly monstrous. The total number of sword wounds he received in this battle was 267. He was shot by 152 bullets. And was hit by 46 cannonballs. And despite all this, his proud back, over the course of his entire life as a pirate, never received a single scar from running away!""";;;;;;;;
3337;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;I'm no one. I don't want to be anyone. All I care about is completing the moon's eye plan. This world is completely worthless. There is nothing left in it but misery.;;;;;;;;
3338;(Naruto);Orochimaru;Either people change or they die before they do. It's one or the other. ;;;;;;;;
3339;(Naruto);Kimimaro;Humans... Do humans have a purpose when they are born? I have been wondering recently. Because they are born, do they have an important duty? The meaning of being born... For humans to find that answer... It is the one freedom God gave them.;;;;;;;;
3340;(Fairy Tail);Makarov Dreyar;Even if I can't see you... No matter how far away you may be... I will always be watching you. ;;;;;;;;
3341;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;I want you to be happy. I want you to laugh a lot. I don't know what exactly I'll be able to do for you, but I'll always be by your side.;;;;;;;;

3343;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;"""Time"" is proof that people have lived. Every person lives the time that has been given to them... that is life. ";;;;;;;;

3347;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;I have told you before, I'm an avenger. I don't care about this test, Chunin or whatever. 'Am I strong?' that's the answer I want.;;;;;;;;
3348;(Bleach);Don Kanonji;Every week, when it is time, they stick to the TV. They watch my actions in the comfort of their families after dinner. Children watch my actions and their hearts leap. They see me stand up to evil spirits and... they know what courage is! Do you understand, boy? With them watching, I can't run away from the enemy;;;;;;;;
3349;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;I can't deny, I don't know very much about Rukia. That's not the point, I might not risk my life for her, but Ichigo wants to save her life and that's all I need to know. What may seem like an unworthy cause to you is more than enough reason for me.;;;;;;;;
3350;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;I am strong. Stronger than all of you. Extremely strong. I can kill all the titans out there. Even if I am alone. ;;;;;;;;
3351;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards. How pathetic. You can just sit here and suck on your fingers. Yeah, do that. ;;;;;;;;
3352;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;The village does have its dark side and its inconsistencies, but I'm still Konoha's Itachi Uchiha.;;;;;;;;
3353;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist.;;;;;;;;
3354;(Naruto);Tobi;It's too late to regret. Reality is just cruelly moving forward.;;;;;;;;
3355;(Bleach);Zangetsu;Abandon your fear. Look forward. Move forward and never stop. You'll age if you pull back. You'll die if you hesitate.;;;;;;;;
3356;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;The difference between your decision and ours is experience. But you don't have to rely on that. CHOOSE... Believe in yourself, or believe in the survey corps and me. I don't know... I never have. I can believe in my own abilities or the choices of the companions I trust. But no one ever knows how it will turn out. So choose for yourself, whichever decision you will regret the least.;;;;;;;;

3360;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war... Those are the two realms belonging solely to man.

3372;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;If you married someone, that means you love every side of your significant other that you already know. So if you find a new side after to love, doesn't that mean you'll love your partner even more?;;;;;;;;

3375;(Naruto);Pain;People are stupid. If I don't do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate's power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That's my wish.;;;;;;;;

3397;(Naruto);Pain;Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain because life's greatest lessons are learned through pain.;;;;;;;;
3398;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;Once you taste poison, you might as well finish the meal. If it comes to that you would make as fine a dish as any.;;;;;;;;
3399;(Noragami);Yato;Even if things are painful and tough, people should appreciate what it means to be alive.;;;;;;;;
3400;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;No matter what my heart will be forever yours and I will fight until the day I see you again.;;;;;;;;

3404;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Although my life hasn't been very fortunate until now, I'm glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune...;;;;;;;;
3405;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;Success comes only to those who have dared to stand up without fear!;;;;;;;;
3406;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;The worst kind of pain is when you're smiling just to stop the tears from falling.;;;;;;;;
3407;(Mirai Nikki);Uryuu Minene;This is the world I live in. The dirty world of the adults.;;;;;;;;

3411;(Naruto);Jiraiya;A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.;;;;;;;;
3412;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;You donÂ´t need a reason to cry. All you need to feel the warmth that dwells in your chest.;;;;;;;;
3413;(No Game No Life);Sora;Sorry. Our world isn't as nice a place as yours. When it comes to war and killing, we have far more expertise than you do.;;;;;;;;
3414;(Kimi ni Todoke);Kazuichi Arai;Blaming others isn't going to resolve anything. There'll be a lot of things that are injust throughout your life. You will have to stand up by yourself.;;;;;;;;
3415;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Hard work is worthless for those that don't believe in themselves.;;;;;;;;
3416;(Hajime no Ippo);Coach Kamogawa;The moment you back down is the moment you lose!;;;;;;;;
3417;(Barakamon);Hiroshi Kido;Being able to work hard is the best talent of all.;;;;;;;;
3418;(Tokyo Ghoul);Yoshimura;It's not because we can't take vengeance that we should feel sorry. The real reason to feel sorry... is when one is hung up on revenge and can't live their own life.;;;;;;;;
3419;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Kenji Yamaguchi;People who say they don't know their own feelings are deluding themselves. It's because you refuse to accept what you're thinking deep down in your heart, you think you don't understand.;;;;;;;;
3420;(One Piece);Eustass Kid;"Compared to the ""righteous"" greed of the rulers, the criminals of the world seem much more honorable. When scum rules the world, only more scum is born.";;;;;;;;
3421;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;If you don't risk your life, you can't create a future. Right?;;;;;;;;
3422;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Christina Mackenzie;"Everyone has to decide for themselves which choice to make. If you fight, people may die... but if you don't fight, people may still die. There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" choice to make.";;;;;;;;

3433;(Little Busters!);Riki Naoe;If you turn your eyes away from sad things, they'll happen again one day. If you keep running away, you'll keep repeating the same mistakes. That's why you have to face the truth straight on.;;;;;;;;
3434;(Psycho-Pass);Kougami Shinya;It's not a matter of real or fake. These avatars are idols on the net. in other words - icons. Icons cannot solely exist through their own will. Neither Hayama nor Sugawara established their status on their own. They were able to become Talsiman and Spooky Boogie because their fans idolized them based on their own distorted perceptions. Their true feelings and colors are not the same as the ideals their characters represents. It's not surprising that a fan could do a better job than the real owners of playing the idol the fans expect to see.;;;;;;;;
3435;(Psycho-Pass);Oryou Rikako;Everyone here is the same. They don't notice anything. They don't say anything. And they don't think anything. They are merely a shell of their former selves and soon they will disappear like the melting snow. This epidemic leads innocent people to their deaths, and yet, its pathogen will never be eradicated. This is a disease called serenity - a form of death that people have wished for.;;;;;;;;
3436;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Misato Katsuragi;So fucking what if I'm not you?! That doesn't mean it's okay for you to give up! If you do, I'll never forgive you as long as I live. God knows I'm not perfect either. I've made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over again, thousands of times. A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself.;;;;;;;;
3437;(Psycho-Pass);Oryou Rikako;"Chastity and grace - traditional virtues that have been lost. They comprise the educational ideology of Ousou Academy. They're priorities that are not valued in boys, only in girls. After having them instilled in us, we're shipped out as brand-name product, refined, sheltered maidens, and purchased by men who seek a classic piece of furniture called ""a good wife and mother"" in a formality known as marriage. Students in this school are all components that will be processed into an artwork called ""the lady"". They are rough stones waiting to be polished and finished up. They live sad and boring lives, even though there are many other possible ways they could bloom.";;;;;;;;
3438;(Psycho-Pass);Toyohisa Senguji;When you entrust so much of your everyday life to those electronic devices, the argument that you aren't a cyborg isn't very convincing. To you, those portable terminals are already your second brain. Isn't that right? It can be said that the history of science is a history of the expansion of the human body's functionality, in other words, the history of man's cyberization. That's why it's a matter of degree.;;;;;;;;
3439;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;You sure say some funny things. Solitude? Does that only apply to me? Who isn't alone in this society? The time when our connection to others was the basis of our selves is long gone. In this world where everyone is watched over by the system and live within the system's standards, a community isn't necessary. Everyone just lives in their own cell, and the system tames them by giving them each their own personal serenity.;;;;;;;;
3440;(Psycho-Pass);Akane Tsunemori;Isn't using the net just like using knives for cooking or using paper to write things down? It has nothing to do with good or bad. It's like, it's there, so we accept and use it.;;;;;;;;
3441;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Some people want power and they get mad when they don't get it. They take their fury out on everyone else. You don't want it, it becomes you. ;;;;;;;;

3443;(Senyuu. 2);Ross;"""I would die for you"" is what the weak say. If you're in love with someone - live for them.";;;;;;;;
3444;(Fushigi Yuugi);Chichiri;There is no such thing as a perfect person. That is why we cannot live alone.;;;;;;;;
3445;(Senyuu. 2);Ross;Can you not be something unless you're already somebody else's something?;;;;;;;;
3446;(Galilei Donna);Galilei;Until now, I had never felt any need to be understood. I had never felt lonely. Not until I met you.;;;;;;;;
3447;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I'm Hatake Kakashi. Things I like and things I hate? I don't feel like telling you that. My dreams for the future? Never really thought about that. As for my hobbies... I have lots of hobbies.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3450;(Galilei Donna);Galilei;All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered. The point is to discover them.;;;;;;;;
3451;(Galilei Donna);Galilei Donna;Everyone has an equal right to live. If you have more than others, you should share with those who have less. If you feel happier than others, help those in need. That is the duty of those who are given so much.;;;;;;;;

3456;(Hentai Ouji To Warawanai Neko);Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi;Communication is the only way people can move ahead.;;;;;;;;
3457;(Hentai Ouji To Warawanai Neko);Azusa Azuki;Do you know about the Happy Prince? It's such a happy story. The Prince helps everyone together with a little swallow, then he dies happily. But I wonder how the swallow felt? His wish wasn't granted because he helped the foolish Prince. Was the swallow really happy? It's always like that. The Prince and all the people he helped are happy, but what about the swallow? He helped the Prince more than anyone, so why is he ignored completely?;;;;;;;;
3458;(Noragami);Yato;Man, kids these days. They think it's a competition to have the most friends. One is enough. Find someone completely unique.;;;;;;;;
3459;(Naruto);Orochimaru;It's human nature not to realize the true value of something, unless they lose it.;;;;;;;;
3460;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;In society, those who don't have many abilities, tend to complain more.;;;;;;;;
3461;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;We all have the right to choose our own future. We should be able to walk the paths that we choose, not the future youÂ´ve decided for us.;;;;;;;;

3469;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;You think you're special? You're not. Everyone lies, everyone hides things... Nobody makes it through this life being completely honest.;;;;;;;;
3470;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;The minute you think of giving up, think of the reason why you held on so long.;;;;;;;;
3471;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.;;;;;;;;
3472;(Fairy Tail);Gajeel Redfox;Care to little, you lose them. Care too much, you get hurt.;;;;;;;;

3489;(No Game No Life);Sora;Only idiots start fights they can't win.;;;;;;;;
3490;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Now that just looks horrible. It's like some feudal society. If that's what it takes to make friends in this world, forever alone is fine by me.;;;;;;;;

3504;(Sword Art Online);Asuna Yūki;I was just dreaming a little. About my old world. It's strange. In the dream, I wondered if everything here, in Aincard, if everything that had happened with you, was only a dream. I was really scared. I'm happy this wasn't a dream.;;;;;;;;
3505;(Sword Art Online);Asuna Yūki;I cried alone every single night. It felt like every day that passed here stole another piece of my real life away. After I cried, I'd go and fight as hard as I could. My only thought was winning, moving forward and getting stronger.;;;;;;;;

3507;(Sword Art Online);Sachi;Even if I die, you keep living okay? Live to see the end of this world, and to see why it was born. Live to see why a weak girl like me ended up here. And the reason you and I met.;;;;;;;;
3508;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;The spring of my heart surges upon the sight of your fresh smile, my love. ;;;;;;;;
3509;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;Do you think you could tell me what true strength is? I may be out of line, but hiding your true self and putting on airs doesn't seem any different than running away to me. I would think that embracing the things you truly like and being able to enjoy them is worth more than anything. To just be yourself… I believe that's what true strength really is. ;;;;;;;;

3516;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won't flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don't go the way he wants them to. That won't help fill the hole in your heart.

I don't want to go on a boring adventure like that!;;;;;;;;
3525;(No Game No Life);Sora;They say people can change, but is that really true? If they decide they want to fly, will they grow wings? I don't think so. You don't change yourself, you change how you do things. You have to make your own way. You have to create a way to fly, even while you stay the same.;;;;;;;;
3526;(No Game No Life);Sora;There is no such thing as luck in this world. Rules, prerequisites, psychological states... There are any number of invisible factors that combine to produce an unpredictable, but inevitable result. The winner of each game is decided before it even begins. Chance is never a factor.;;;;;;;;

3532;(Project K: Days Of Blue);Reisi Munakata;Family is the society that you came into contact with first;;;;;;;;
3533;(Gintama);Shimura Tae;No matter how beautiful a person may be, they will still age and ultimately - die. But even so, even if appearances change, don't you believe that we have, in us, things that don't change? Even as our bodies crumble, even as the months and years take their toll... don't you believe that we all have something that time can't spoil? Even if you cover us with wrinkles, we won't lose to you. That's because we know what beauty truly is.;;;;;;;;
3534;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;People need to live their life with a clear conscience. When you want to walk on a straight path, somehow you get yourself stained with mud. However, as long as we never give up, one day the mud on you will dry up and fall off.;;;;;;;;

3540;(Sengoku Basara);Katakura Kojūrō;We will not just fade away, thought there's no way to know how long it may last. We WILL leave our mark on this world!;;;;;;;;
3541;(Vandread);Hibiki Tokai;The Time is now for us to start something new. Everybody's struggling, you think you're special - you're not. Forget it, there's no time. Don't try to hide in the corner barking and don't take your aggression out on others. If you got time for that, step forward and stand tall, it's our future and no one is gonna give it to us. It's a future that we're gonna build for ourselves, with our very own hands. What's the point in being at the mercy of others. You can't lose as long as you don't give up. No matter how trapped you feel, no matter how unfair you think it is. The only thing that matters is what you see, with your own two eyes. What hope do you have if you turn away from that? What can you hope to achieve without facing the cold hard truth? A person has to have a reason to live, but you don't need any excuse to die.;;;;;;;;
3542;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;There are two kinds of fights. As long as we place ourselves in battle, we must always know the difference, a fight to defend life or a fight to defend pride.;;;;;;;;
3543;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;Death no longer terrifies man, the smell of blood is as common as the smell of white plums. So, he creates slavery and savagery... which surpasses the horror of dying.;;;;;;;;

3558;(Binbougami Ga!);Binboda Momiji;You're your own worst enemy. If your worries and doubts torment you, then just stop thinking about them.;;;;;;;;
3559;(Rozen Maiden);Shinku;The world is full of choices unseen. With the willingness to notice, anyone can choose a world of their very own, from an infinity of choices.;;;;;;;;
3560;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;If you don't like your destiny, don't accept it. Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want it to be!;;;;;;;;
3561;(Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei);Tatsuya Shiba;"It's a nice thought to believe in a ""next time"". If it was a real battlefield, there wouldn't be a ""next time"".";;;;;;;;
3562;(Tamako Market);Kunio Yaobi;If you think music is only made of sounds, you're mistaken. Silence is also part of music.;;;;;;;;
3563;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;I hate memories. Because reality is better than memories. A reality where I exist and you're here right next to me.;;;;;;;;
3564;(Kill la Kill);Tsumugu Kinagase;Victory isn't determined solely by who has the superior physical abilities.;;;;;;;;
3565;(One Piece);Brook;It's over when you give up.;;;;;;;;
3566;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Reborn;You came into my life as a story, you left as a legend.;;;;;;;;
3567;(Free!);Haruka Nanase;I've seen this before. This sensation... I get it now. This is what I wanted. No need to rely on or work with other people. I just want to drift through the water alone in silence.;;;;;;;;
3568;(Kuroko No Basket);Teppei Kiyoshi;For living creatures, Victory if Life, and Defeat means Death.;;;;;;;;
3569;(One Piece);Portgas D. Ace;We have to live a life of no regrets.;;;;;;;;
3570;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;If there's no one happy, is it really a victory?;;;;;;;;
3571;(Little Busters!);Riki Naoe;Nothing good can come by rejecting yourself.;;;;;;;;
3572;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Alis Color;We simply cannot see the world as it is. The world people see is nothing more than how our brains translate it. In other words, it's subjective.;;;;;;;;
3573;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;The same thing as always. No matter how many times I reach game over and no matter how many times I must pathetically hit continue, I will not stop moving forward.;;;;;;;;
3574;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;The real sin is averting your eyes and failing to believe in anyone.;;;;;;;;
3575;(Fairy Tail);Mavis Vermillion;Comrade isn't simply a word. Comrades are about heart. It's the unconditional trust in your partners. Please, feel free to lean on me.... And I, too, will lean on you as well.;;;;;;;;
3576;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Kaoru Yamazaki;Feelings of romantic love are, in the end, just some chemical reaction. Under the right conditions, they occur no matter who the other person is.;;;;;;;;
3577;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;In essence, language accounts for a mere 30% of human communication. The other 70% is made up of information collected from eye movements and other body language. With that, even a loner who never takes part in conversation can pull off 70% of what we consider communication.;;;;;;;;
3578;(Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi);Hampnie Hambart;"Remember this. The only words that can keep you alive are ""I want to live.""";;;;;;;;
3579;(Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX);Manjoume Jun;Sorry. I don't believe in fate. I explore my future with my own strength. Good or bad, it's my own choice.;;;;;;;;
3580;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;"I don't like the terms ""good person"" or ""bad person"" because it's impossible to be entirely good to everyone or entirely bad to everyone. To some, you are a good person, while to others, you are a bad person. ";;;;;;;;
3581;(Beck);Eddie Lee;If you live life by other people's standards, then your life is no longer yours.;;;;;;;;
3582;(Beck);Yuji Sakurai;There are two types of people in this world - those who do what they're told and those who stay true to themselves. Most people think you're supposed to follow a predetermined path, keep your head down, obey the rules, do whatever's popular. But some prefer to follow their own path in life.;;;;;;;;
3583;(Code:Breaker);Ogami Rei;Giving into the pain and thinking you want to die just means you've been spoiled by life. If you don't want to die, then don't act spoiled. Suffer through life;;;;;;;;
3584;(Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita);Watashi;This is how culture spreads. When someone has a new idea, it is immediately copied.;;;;;;;;
3585;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Aoi Asahina;Real strength only reveals itself when one is faced with great turmoil! Therefore, I shall always tread a thorny path!;;;;;;;;
3586;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Life is basically like a soap bubble. It rides on the wind, flying here and there... and before you realize it - pop! It's gone. When it's about to disappear, you think that you could've flown a little higher. But by the time, it's already too late.;;;;;;;;
3587;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;That's what I call smallness as a human being. No matter how much I'm irritated by it, I can't do anything about it. It's not complex, just stunted. Because as a human being I'm small, or something.;;;;;;;;
3588;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Sorata Kanda;Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. But it wasn't the days that felt boring. It was being just like everyone else.;;;;;;;;
3589;(Sword of the Stranger);Nanashi;Those who have no skill, require harsh instruction if they are to have any hope to get any better.;;;;;;;;
3590;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Izumi Curtis;When you live, your life will end sooner or later. The body will return to the earth. Grass and flowers will grow on top of it. The soul will nourish the hearts... and it will live on in the hearts of other people. Everything in this world flows around and circulates. That goes for human lives too.;;;;;;;;
3591;(Darker than Black);Hei;Spilled water will never return to its container.;;;;;;;;
3592;(Kimi no Iru Machi);Yuzuki Eba;As long as you do not give up, nothing is over.;;;;;;;;
3593;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Accelerator;Listen up, kid. There's one thing you need to understand. Human life is a fragile thing. So weak that I can destroy it with a touch of my finger. So watch what you say. If you don't, I may break something I shouldn't.;;;;;;;;
3594;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;Nothing can suppress a human's curiosity.;;;;;;;;
3595;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;There's no meaningful difference between a real and a virtual world. It's pointless to ask anyone who they really are. All you can do is accept and believe in them, because whoever they are in your mind, is their true identity. ;;;;;;;;
3596;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Makoto Naegi;If the world outside is void of hope, and if despair is contagious, then I'll just have to infect everyone with my hope. Living in despair really isn't living at all.;;;;;;;;
3597;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Aoi Asahina;"Sakura-chan would probably say ""Strength can only be obtained by standing up to adversity. So I choose to walk down the path filled with thorns.""";;;;;;;;
3598;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Nino;I want to hear who you are, not what you have.;;;;;;;;
3599;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;When people are protecting something truly special to them, they truly can become... as strong as they can be.;;;;;;;;
3600;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;There's no advantage to hurrying through life.;;;;;;;;
3601;(Black Lagoon);Okajima Rokuro;I'm no saint. A sense of duty, a sense of righteousness - they're just nuisances in life.;;;;;;;;
3602;(Casshern Sins);Dune;I want to live... I want to hold something in my hands and feel its warmth.;;;;;;;;
3603;(Casshern Sins);Akoes;Anyone can make a mistake. If you feel bad about it, will that sin disappear?;;;;;;;;
3604;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Good and bad are human concepts, so something that is not human cannot be classified as neither good nor bad.;;;;;;;;
3605;(Kuroko No Basket);Akashi Seijuurou;When I tell you to leave, leave. In this world, winning is everything. Winners are affirmed completely, and losers are denied completely. I've never lost at anything before, and I never will. Because I always win, and I'm always right. I show no mercy to those who oppose me, not even my own parents.;;;;;;;;
3606;(Eureka Seven);Charles Beams;Don't worry about being so considerate of adults. You can only be a kid for so long, so you might as well enjoy it.;;;;;;;;
3607;(Denpa Kyoushi);Kagami Junichirou;Even though there's such a thing as an impossible game, there's no such thing as an impossible reality.;;;;;;;;
3608;(Bleach);Kajoumaru Hidetomo;If one side was just, it would be called a defense or a suppression. But this is war. And wars happen because both sides are just.;;;;;;;;
3609;(Suisei no Gargantia);Litonar;To someone who bears responsibility, there's no greater treasure than experience.;;;;;;;;
3610;(Uchuu Kyoudai);Reiji Nitta;If you're felling like there's nowhere you belong... That you're trapped in a small world. It's those feelings that drive us beyond our world. ;;;;;;;;
3611;(Bakemonogatari);Meme Oshino;People have to save themselves. One person saving another is impossible.;;;;;;;;
3612;(Bakemonogatari);Shinobu Oshino;It's difficult to change the world on your own, but twisting it a little might not be all that hard.;;;;;;;;
3613;(Kimi ni Todoke);Sawako Kuronuma;The longer you're with someone, the tougher it is to part ways.;;;;;;;;
3614;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;All I need is the power to be able to protect my comrades. So long as I can have the strength to do that, I don't care if I'm weaker than everyone else in the world.;;;;;;;;
3615;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Winry Rockbell;There are some things in life that will only be understood through words.;;;;;;;;
3616;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;You yourself have to change first, or nothing will change for you.;;;;;;;;
3617;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.;;;;;;;;
3618;(Kuroko No Basket);Taiga Kagami;This is our show. We're the ones who are writing the script.;;;;;;;;
3619;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;
3620;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;The trick of real combat is that everyone is human.;;;;;;;;
3621;(One Piece);Jinbei;Don't just think about the ones you have lost. You can't get back what you have lost. What is it that you still have ?;;;;;;;;
3622;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;What is right? What is wrong? In this mixed up world, deciding what is right and wrong is not easy. You can't just go by somebody else's rules. If you let yourself be controlled like that, you'll just become a puppet that can't make decisions on it's own. You have to live by your rules. ;;;;;;;;
3623;(Mushibugyou);Genjuurou Tsukishima;If we are frightened, the people behind us will be, as well. You must be a shining star... that washes away fear, so that those behind you wil not be afraid!;;;;;;;;
3624;(Kuroko No Basket);Midorima Shintarou;How you change is up to you. ;;;;;;;;
3625;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;If we're unable to climb down the mountain, then we won't know whether there's another mountain to climb up.;;;;;;;;
3626;(Hajime no Ippo);Coach Kamogawa;Why are you punching? What are you chasing? You should already know the answer to that. To become strong.;;;;;;;;
3627;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;No single thing is perfect by itself. That's why we're born to attract other things to make up for what we lack. I think we start walking in the right direction only after we start getting our counterparts beside us.;;;;;;;;
3628;();Rain;Being frightened of a strong enemy is perfectly natural. Confidence is something you build up, triumph upon triumph. ;;;;;;;;
3629;(Gekkou);Konan;Bare emotions tell the truth much eloquently than any justification.;;;;;;;;
3630;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;The past and the future are not the same, but they're not completely separate either.;;;;;;;;
3631;(Princess Lover!);Yu Fujikura;For people like us, we do not have a choice over the environment we're in, but we get to decide what we will make of it and what path we will take from there.;;;;;;;;
3632;(FLCL);Naota Nandaba;When you're on a bike, the ocean's a lot closer than you think. The autumn salt wind went right through to the back of my nose. And maybe it's because, like Haruko said, my head was empty.;;;;;;;;
3633;(Ai no Kusabi);Riki;When extremes are reached, evil turns to virtue.;;;;;;;;
3634;(Gatchaman Crowds);Hajime Ichinose;It's scary to decide, isn't it? But we have to decide something. If we make a decision, things might change.;;;;;;;;
3635;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Our injuries will heal as long as we're alive. But the scars will remain.;;;;;;;;
3636;(Hagure Yuusha No Estetica);Ousawa Akatsuki;If we only believe when the odds are with us, then that's not believing at all.;;;;;;;;
3637;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Sorata Kanda;I pretended it was someone else's fault that nothing happened. But I was wrong. If you put your mind to it, you can change the color of your world in an instant.;;;;;;;;
3638;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;I realized why I was lost. It's not because I didn't have a map... It was because I didn't have a destination.;;;;;;;;
3639;(Hyouka);Oreki Houtarou;I'm not stupid. I'm just too lazy to show how smart I am.;;;;;;;;
3640;(Aria The Natural);Alicia Florence;When I was a child, whenever it snowed, I would play and make snowballs. When you start rolling a snowball, someone will always appear out of nowhere and help you make it bigger and in the end, everyone goes home satisfied. It was then that I suddenly thought “This is what I want to grow up to be like”.;;;;;;;;
3641;(Bakemonogatari);Meme Oshino;I am not going to take sides, I am neutral. I am talking about standpoints here, that is all. Miss Class Representative (Hanekawa Tsubasa) has her point of view and her parents have their own. There is no way for an outsider to know which of them is right. Actually, there is not a right one in the first place. It is just about who is easier to agree with.;;;;;;;;
3642;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;Do not lose to the obstacles that you will meet in the future. I have my own set of goals but do not pursue them because of my laziness.;;;;;;;;
3643;(Hajime no Ippo);Coach Kamogawa;Run until you can't run anymore, and then run again. Constant effort is life's greatest shortcut.;;;;;;;;
3644;(Rewrite);Kotori Kanbe;A garden retains its beauty as long as it is tended to and cared for. Life in general, is the same. Once it becomes pretty, it mustn't go back to being the primitive mess it started out as.;;;;;;;;
3645;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Fake people have an image to maintain. Real people just don't care.;;;;;;;;
3646;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Knowing what it feels to be in pain, is exactly why we try to be kind to others.;;;;;;;;
3647;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;Although I'm weak and full of flaws, I will never stop moving forward. No matter who I am, no one other than myself will create my own existence. No matter what others may think or feel, I will still move forward as myself.;;;;;;;;
3648;(The Garden of Sinners);Ryougi Shiki;A person can only murder another once. The act of murder is giving up the humanity that is within oneself. What is left is just emptiness. You can not lose humanity if it is already lost. The act of murder turns into the act of slaughter. They are two different things.;;;;;;;;
3649;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;If you don't take risks, you can't create a future.;;;;;;;;
3650;(Koko Ni Iru Yo!);Sumino Hikage;"On the internet, we only know each other's usernames. If we were talking face to face, I probably would never talk to them this way. They look at the ""Real Me"". They support me a lot... I wish there were more people like them.";;;;;;;;
3651;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;You only understand the true value of things after you've lost them.;;;;;;;;
3652;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Yuusha;Words alone, can make an entire army withdraw.;;;;;;;;
3653;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Moping around with sadness and sorrow... what will come of it? Even dead people can do that. However, I'll live and stand on my own two legs. If we are going to die one day, wouldn't it be better to have no regrets?;;;;;;;;
3654;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;The world is destined for even greater chaos.;;;;;;;;
3655;(Magic Knight Rayearth);Princess Emeraude;Remember this... no matter where you go, the strength of your mind and spirit is the most powerful magic of all.;;;;;;;;
3656;(Ao no Exorcist);Shura Kirigakure;You didn't raise a weapon. You raised a son. ;;;;;;;;
3657;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;You should keep your distance from me if you want to live. My place is in the shadows, yours in the light. We walk opposite paths, Aberline. It's best that you remember that. ;;;;;;;;
3658;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;You want to keep everyone from dying? That's naive. It's war. People die.;;;;;;;;
3659;(Guilty Crown);Oogumo;When you confess your feelings, you should do a proper job.;;;;;;;;
3660;(Kakumeiki Valvrave);Senator Figaro;I'm neither a soldier, nor a brave man. Not to mention that running away isn't the same thing as losing. You only truly lose by dying. So as long you're alive, you win! ;;;;;;;;
3661;(Saiyuki);Saiyuki;A past will chase you if you try to escape from it, but once you confront it, it's just an old memory inside you.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3664;(Danganronpa: Kibou No Gakuen To Zetsubou No Koukousei);Ludenberg Celestia;I'm rather proud of my ability to tell lies. I can trick not only others, but even my own heart.;;;;;;;;
3665;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Setsuna F. Seiei;The meaning to our existence... is to live. To remember those who have died and face the world. God doesn't exist. I will. Through my own will.;;;;;;;;
3666;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;It's not that you don't know how to interact with people. It's just that no one ever came to interact with you.;;;;;;;;
3667;(Kokoro Connect);Taichi Yaegashi;When you're hiding a secret from the whole world, it puts a weight on your shoulders.;;;;;;;;
3668;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;Everything doesn't have to be decided by life and death. Just think about the future.;;;;;;;;
3669;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Misaki Kamiigusa;We found ourselves in conflict with each other many times. There were hard times when we wanted to run away or give up. But it was only because that rain fell, that the seeds of our emotions could sprout. And the flowers of deeper friendship could bloom.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3674;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Before creation there must be destruction. If my soul stands in the way, then I'll toss it aside. Yes, I have no choice but to move forward. ;;;;;;;;
3675;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;Everyone can make a choice after they have learned what it will result in. It is so easy to say we should have done it this way afterwards. But you can't know what your choice will result in before actually choosing.;;;;;;;;
3676;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;You must look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self reveal itself.;;;;;;;;
3677;(Hyouka);Oreki Houtarou;I'm not against socializing, so long as it's not tiring.;;;;;;;;
3678;(Black Lagoon);Revy;Rock, if you think about it, other than this, what do we really value in life? God? Love? Don't make me laugh. When I was a brat, crawling around in that shithole city, it seemed God and Love were always sold out when I went looking. Before I knew better, I clung to God and prayed to Him every single night — yeah, I believed in God right up until that night the cops beat the hell out of me for no reason at all. All they saw when they looked at me was another little ghetto rat. With no power and no God, what's left for a poor little Chinese bitch to rely on? It's money, of course, and guns. Fuckin' A. With these two things, the world's a great place.;;;;;;;;
3679;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;If you're lonely, you should say something! If you're worried, say something! Most people aren't as sharp as you are! If you want those people to understand you, you should say something! Even if you're worried that you'll embarrass yourself, you should still say something!;;;;;;;;
3680;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;I haven't lived all that long yet, but there is something I firmly believe in. The people who have the ability to change something in this world, all without exception, have the guts to abandon things important to them if they have to. They are those who can abandon even their humanity.;;;;;;;;
3681;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Why are you staring at me? Are you annoyed that I am the only one who has cake?;;;;;;;;
3682;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;To climb a hill on a difficult road, you need to be walking steadily.;;;;;;;;
3683;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;Gohan, you showed me that power is nothing without being guided without love.;;;;;;;;
3684;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;I don't think anyone is born knowing the reason why they're here. It's just something you have to find as you go along.;;;;;;;;
3685;(Hellsing);Alucard;To become a monster like me, is to admit you were too weak to remain a human.;;;;;;;;
3686;(Shakugan no Shana);Shana;"Those who rely on ""someday"" will only grow weaker and lowlier.";;;;;;;;
3687;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Greed;"""I long to see someone who died"", ""I want to be rich"", ""I want women"", ""I want to protect the world""... They're all desires. In other words, wishes. If you ask me, there's neither ""right"" or ""wrong"" when it comes to greed. You humans go around ranking certain types of greed in order from good to bad, which makes you so hard to understand.";;;;;;;;
3688;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;Sometimes, we have to look beyond what we want and do what's best.;;;;;;;;
3689;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Charles Zi Britannia;The world lies! Thou shalt not commit murder, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not cheat, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. All of these are lies! Mere illusions and nothing more! They don't want to be killed, they don't want to be robbed, using the twin lies of justice and morality, the weak are endeavoring to protect themselves. But the first truth is that the strong devour the weak, so let us feed upon people, upon wealth, upon riches and power! We, at Britannia, shall feast upon the raw flesh of the world itself! We will crush this deception and bring forth the truth! All Hail Britannia!;;;;;;;;
3690;(Devil Survivor 2);Alcor;Denying possibility is denying thought.;;;;;;;;
3691;(Death Note);Soichiro Yagami;Laws aren't perfect, because humans who created laws aren't perfect. It's impossible to be perfect. However, the laws are evidence of the human's struggle to be righteous.;;;;;;;;
3692;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;It's stupid to talk about things you're not. Be yourself and you'll be fine.;;;;;;;;
3693;(NANA);Kawamura Sachiko;We are all farsighted, we give importance to those things that are far from us, while neglecting the things that are close to us... only to realize their value later, when they are out-of-reach again.;;;;;;;;
3694;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Manga endings might always end the same. However, if it comes to life. Neither you or I are mere readers. We are writers. We can change the ending.;;;;;;;;
3695;(Black Lagoon);Black Lagoon;People are like dice, a certain Frenchman said that. You throw yourself in the direction of your own choosing. People are free because they can do that. Everyone's circumstances are different, but no matter how small the choice, at the very least, you can throw yourself. It's not chance or fate. It's the choice you made.;;;;;;;;
3696;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Murder doesn't necessarily mean evil, right? The world being what it is, a lot of people out there deserve to die, don't they? But those who do take it upon themselves to kill others, have to be prepared to have others try to kill them as well. And that's what they call the law of Karma, my friends. That's why good or bad, the only ones who are going to be left standing are the ones with the strongest wills to survive.;;;;;;;;
3697;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Time flows constantly, it doesn't care about the people who are struggling. ;;;;;;;;
3698;(Kekkaishi);Priest;The world is not meant just to be looked at, it’s important to get the feel of things. Don’t be captivated just by what’s in front of you and neglect the rest. Free your mind from evil and accept everything as it is. This is what we call enlightenment.;;;;;;;;
3699;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;"I love this game that people call ""life"" from the bottom of my heart.";;;;;;;;
3700;(Naruto);Ohnoki;It's because I've experienced pain in the past, that I can even consider what would be best for the future!;;;;;;;;
3701;(Deadman Wonderland);Deadman Wonderland;What do you suppose the most irrational thing is? - It's humanity.;;;;;;;;
3702;(Deadman Wonderland);Ikazuchi Akatsuki;"The world consists of ""choices"", in other words, it consists of continual gamble. Other guys are not aware of this. Thus they moved about in confusion.";;;;;;;;
3703;(Deadman Wonderland);Ganta Igarashi;There's nothing that won't change, every day things will change a little bit more.;;;;;;;;
3704;(Hellsing);Alucard;Resignation is what kills people. Once they've rejected resignation, humans gain the privilege of making humanity their footpath.;;;;;;;;
3705;(Fate/stay night);Kotomine Kirei;A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil. It's different from angels, who know only of good since birth. Humans have evil, but can live as good, so they are superior to angels, who know only good.;;;;;;;;
3706;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;Reject common sense to make the impossible possible!;;;;;;;;
3707;(Uchuu Kyoudai);Deneil Young;Some things can't be prevented. The last of which, is death. All we can do is live until the day we die. Control what we can... and fly free!;;;;;;;;
3708;(Black Lagoon);Revy;God is emotional bullshit.;;;;;;;;
3709;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;Whatever your thoughts may be, if you don't say them, none of it will be acknowledged by others.;;;;;;;;
3710;(Bakuman);Miho Azuki;I think having a dream, working hard, and never giving up couldn't possibly bring misfortune.;;;;;;;;

3717;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;I don't care what the society says. I've regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to.;;;;;;;;
3718;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;The fear of interacting with people...even I understand that one.;;;;;;;;
3719;(Kokoro Connect);Iori Nagase;You can never tell what'll happen next in life. But so long as you have faith in your feet, the road you walk will be a part of you.;;;;;;;;
3720;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Yoki;There's nothing that's entirely black or white.;;;;;;;;
3721;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Shinobu Sensui;Drop ink on the finest snow-white paper and it will inevitably absorb into black. Its purity demands it. Tainted men have immunities. Black does not absorb black.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3724;(One Piece);Crocodile;"""If I do this, I can stop the rebellion"", ""if I do that, I can stop the rebellion""... Open your eyes, princess! Your zealous idealism disgusts me! Ideals can only be spoken by those powerful enough to carry them out. And that excludes you!";;;;;;;;
3725;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sayaka Miki;The balance between hope and despair keeps itself to zero. When was it you told me that? I understand what you mean now, I did save quite a few people, but in exchange hatred and jealousy filled my heart, I even hurt my best friend. Someone has to be cursed to balance out a wish for someone else's happiness.;;;;;;;;
3726;(Gekkou);Nonomiya;Sometimes the truth can hurt others more than a lie.;;;;;;;;
3727;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;Regardless of our limitations, we can always be of some use. Our power may seem insignificant... but it may just prove to be useful in the grand scheme of things. Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world. Which is why everyone must stay alert and ready to strike at any moment!;;;;;;;;
3728;(RDG: Red Data Girl);Souda Manatsu;Humans have the ability to actively put things to an end rather than simply accept what's in store.;;;;;;;;
3729;(RDG: Red Data Girl);Miyuki Sagara;I want to find a path that no one else had taken into consideration.;;;;;;;;
3730;(The Garden of Sinners);Aozaki Touko;There are three conditions to terrify someone: One, the monster can't speak. Two, the monster has to be unidentifiable. Three, it's meaningless if the monster can die.;;;;;;;;
3731;(Mirai Nikki);Uryuu Minene;It's not possible to save everything. Prioritize your goals.;;;;;;;;
3732;(Ergo Proxy);Ergo Proxy;Even if I was someone, people couldn't comprehend me. And even if they could, they wouldn't be able to communicate it to those around them. I do not belong to the world. That is the world's limit, the boundary between the world and the self.;;;;;;;;
3733;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seta Soujirou;When you are trying to rebuild a build that was made incorrectly, you first have to destroy it. I thought this was the true.;;;;;;;;
3734;(Cowboy Bebop);Vincent Volaju;No one can draw a clear line between sane and insane. You move that line as you see fit for yourself. No one else can. You'll understand soon... that the one that's insane is this world.;;;;;;;;
3735;(Paprika);Atsuko Chiba;Don't you think dreams and the Internet are similar? They are both areas where the repressed conscious mind vents.;;;;;;;;
3736;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;If fighting could provide us with the truth, nobody would make any mistakes in their lives. A person's life is not that easy. The truth you must learn from yourself, from how you live your life.;;;;;;;;
3737;(Ergo Proxy);Ergo Proxy;From the perspective of others I am part of the world, but when I observe the world from my perspective I am nowhere to be found. To observe is to create perspective. I can never cease to be the point of origin from my perspective. I observe that which is not myself. This is the first principle to find.;;;;;;;;
3738;(Ergo Proxy);Hoody;A lie is truth, until you recognize it as a lie. To see the truth behind those lies is probably the right thing to do. However, it may not necessarily bring happiness. Lies are Happiness.;;;;;;;;
3739;(Cowboy Bebop);Vincent Volaju;Know much about purgatory? It's the place between heaven and hell, where those who were left behind, unable to get into heaven continue to suffer, a place of struggle and pain. In other words, the world that we're in now. ;;;;;;;;
3740;(Uchuu Kyoudai);Deneil Young;Do what you can until you learn what you need. If you're going to try something, you may as well aim for the top.;;;;;;;;
3741;(Naruto);Orochimaru;Real power is forged from the desire smoldering in the heart. It fans into a flame and begins to burn with an intensity scarcely imagined to be possible.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3743;(Ergo Proxy);Ergo Proxy;Remember. You can feel it if you hold your hand against your chest. It belongs to no one. It's our pulse, yours and mine. This is what brings us to the truth. It's what proves that we are the very world itself. Follow your instincts. The answer is already there.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3746;(Monster);Johann Liebert;There's nothing special about being born. Not a thing. Most of the universe is just death, nothing more. In this universe of ours, the birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny, insignificant flash. Death is a normal thing. So why live?;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3749;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;In our society, letting others find out that you're a nice person is a very risky move. It's extremely likely that someone would take advantage of that.;;;;;;;;
3750;(Chrono Crusade);Rosette Christopher;Because my time is limited, I don't have any time to waste hesitating. That is why I can walk straight ahead. That is why I never stop.;;;;;;;;
3751;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Now I feel that maybe knowing who I actually am is the key to reach perfection. Because that means knowing what I can and cannot do.;;;;;;;;
3752;(Bleach);Ayasegawa Yumichika;Who are you again? Sorry, I have a bad memory for ugly faces.;;;;;;;;
3753;(Samurai Champloo);Kagetoki Kariya;Only hope can give rise to the emotion we call despair. But it is nearly impossible for a man to try to live without hope, so I guess that leaves Man no choice but to walk around with despair as his companion.;;;;;;;;
3754;(Kuroko No Basket);Kuroko No Basket;"No matter how hard you practice, ""someday"" and ""maybe"" aren't good enough. I need to know if you have ambitious goals and the will to accomplish them.";;;;;;;;
3755;(Eyeshield 21);Hiruma Youichi;Trying without the winning intent is meaningless.;;;;;;;;
3756;(Fate/zero);Saber;Of what worth is a king who fails to protect the powerless?;;;;;;;;
3757;(Death Note);Light Yagami;Under normal circumstances, humans should have continued to evolve as the greatest creatures upon this earth, but we were actually regressing. A rotten world. Politics, law, education... Was there anybody around who could correct this world? But someone had to do it.;;;;;;;;
3758;(Eyeshield 21);Hiruma Youichi;"Do you understand how to handle cards now? I win as long as I can make you think ""there's no way he will play that card"".";;;;;;;;
3759;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;Sinful? Corrupt? I don't understand your logic. Why must pleasure and sin be connected? Pleasure gotten through evil means could be a sin. But pleasure can also result from good deeds. What kind of philosophy calls pleasure itself a sin?;;;;;;;;
3760;(Psycho-Pass);Akane Tsunemori;"It's not the final judgement of ""good"" and ""evil"" that's important. What matters is that you come to that decision yourself. That you agonize over it and eventually accept it.";;;;;;;;
3761;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Life that has been lost cannot be brought back again. That very truth is what shows us the meaning and value ;;;;;;;;
"of living.""";;;;;;;;;;;
3762;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?;;;;;;;;
3763;(Blood Lad);Charlie Staz;The ones who do what they want and enjoy the most of their lives are the ones who win in the end.;;;;;;;;
3764;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hoshimura Junichirou;If you dislike the situation, use your strength to change it.;;;;;;;;
3765;(Shinsekai Yori);Shinsekai Yori;The power of imagination is what changes everything.;;;;;;;;
3766;(Fate/zero);Caster;Fright is about the feeling that you will die. The true meaning of terror doesn't lie in a static condition, but in a change.;;;;;;;;
3767;(One Piece);Brook;No matter how deep the night, it always turns to day, eventually.;;;;;;;;
3768;(Fate/zero);Matou Kariya;Children's minds are immature. They do not possess a firm resolve and the strength to turn their misery to anger. Confronted with a cruel fate, they were not provided with the choice of having a strong will. Moreover, as they have not lived through and comprehended life, ideals such as honor and hope are yet to be completely nurtured in them. Therefore, in moments of despair, children are more prone than adults to seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart. Because they have not tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard. Because they have not understood the meaning of future, they can sink into despair.;;;;;;;;
3769;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;Even if no one in the world believes you, stick out your chest and scream in defiance.;;;;;;;;
3770;(Bleach);Ayasegawa Yumichika;Discouraging, isn't it? It's always easier to tear down than to build... And much more difficult to tie than to untie.;;;;;;;;
3771;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;Why don't you buy paper books? E-books lack character.;;;;;;;;
3772;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Suzaku Kururugi;The best way to remove your lies is to make them come true.;;;;;;;;
3773;(Bleach);Soi Fon;Things like protecting the world are no more than moral reasons that sound good.;;;;;;;;
3774;(Gintama);Hijikata Toushirou;If you run into a wall and pretend it doesn't exist, you'll never make progress. The wall will never change, so you're the one who has to change.;;;;;;;;
3775;(Fate/zero);Kotomine Risei;One's true worth shows as hardship increases.;;;;;;;;
3776;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;Moving on doesn't mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what's happened and continue living.;;;;;;;;
3777;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;You wanted revenge? You're just making other people as miserable as you. Revenge is just the path you took to escape your suffering.;;;;;;;;
3778;(Maoyuu Maou Yuusha);Maou;The freedom to do better than you do now, to be better than you are now. The spirit did not create us perfectly good. She gave us the freedom to keep trying to be better everyday.;;;;;;;;
3779;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;When people have different opinions, you should apply the majority vote.;;;;;;;;
3780;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;I think the best disciplining is pain.;;;;;;;;
3781;(K Project);Mikoto Suoh;Our bodies get bigger, but our hearts get torn up.;;;;;;;;
3782;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Any man who has the brains to think and the nerve to act for the benefit of the people of the country, is considered a radical, by those who are content with stagnation and willing to endure disaster.;;;;;;;;
3783;(Trigun);Millions Knives;If you let the fly live, the spider is going to die. You can't save both without one suffering.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3785;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;Is it that you get the power, then you choose to protect someone else? No! We first want to protect someone, that's why we try to get stronger in the first place.;;;;;;;;
3786;(Mirai Nikki);Akise Aru;Whether I win or lose is up to me.;;;;;;;;
3787;(Asu No Yoichi);Yoichi Karasuma;"There is no match that you know that ""you can't win"". Even if a match like that exists, the thing that decides the defeat is your heart. That makes you think you've ""lost"".";;;;;;;;
3788;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;So what if the government collapses or the country is ruined? I'm not civic-minded! All I want to do is stand tall and live on until the day I collapse and die!;;;;;;;;
3789;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Failing doesn't give you a reason to give up as long as you believe.;;;;;;;;
3790;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;No matter how hard or impossible it is, never lose sight of your goal.;;;;;;;;

3794;(The Girl Who Leapt Through Time);The Girl Who Leapt Through Time;Time waits for no one.;;;;;;;;
3795;(Pet Shop of Horrors);Count D;True destiny cannot be changed. The reason is actually quite simple. True destiny isn't granted - it is earned. ;;;;;;;;
3796;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;If the father's responsibility is to protect the child... then my responsibility is to exceed the father.;;;;;;;;
3797;(Saint Seiya);Virgo Shaka;The flowers bloom, then wither... The stars shine and one day become extinct. This earth, the sun, the galaxies and even the big universe,;;;;;;;;
someday will be destroyed. Compared with that; the human life is only a blink; just a little time. In that short time - people are born; laugh; cry; fight; are injured; feel joy; sadness; hate someone; love someone. All in just a moment. And then; are embraced by the eternal sleep called death.
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3799;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;When I was at the brink of life and death, I used all of my will to survive. I drew upon a different power than that of self-sacrifice and mastered an ultimate technique. The will to live is stronger than anything else. That was the ray of light that my master risked his life to show me. As Hitokiri Battousai, I have committed so many crimes that I cannot possibly repent for them. That is why I had secretly believed that it didn't matter when I died or was killed. However, now... even if I am formally punished or restrained. I will never lose the will to live.;;;;;;;;
3800;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Yozora Mikazuki;It doesn't matter if you can make 100 friends. Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 is to them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it's a friend that you care about.;;;;;;;;
3801;(Accel World);Kuroyukihime;No need to be afraid of the end, because this world is infinite!;;;;;;;;
3802;(Hyouka);Eru Chitanda;If someone didn't have any pride, wouldn't they also be lacking in self-confidence? If someone was free of greed, wouldn't they have trouble supporting their family? And if people didn't envy one another, wouldn't they stop inventing new things? ;;;;;;;;
3803;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko;If you have friends - you'll have a full life. And if you don't, you can still manage somehow.;;;;;;;;
3804;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Setsuna F. Seiei;Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.;;;;;;;;
3805;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;You want to kill me? You couldn't even kill my boredom!;;;;;;;;
3806;(One Piece);Tony Tony Chopper;I realized that back then, the reason I wanted to become human, was that I really just wanted to have friends. Now, I just want to be a monster that can help Luffy.;;;;;;;;
3807;(Hajime no Ippo);Coach Kamogawa;There are times when working hard may not be enough. But those who succeed worked hard.;;;;;;;;
3808;(Ao no Exorcist);Fujimoto Shirou;If you don't like to be treated like a kid, then why don't you try showing how much you have grown up.;;;;;;;;
3809;(Air Gear);Itsuki Minami;A frog in a well does not hope to swim in the ocean, or go to dive in deep sea. What they're looking at since they are born, isn't the ocean, but the sky.;;;;;;;;
3810;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko;People can live without friends. Friends are not oxygen or water, they're more like luxury goods.;;;;;;;;

3814;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
3820;(Devil Survivor 2);Alcor;Living is anxiety and pain. It's continuing to think, continuing to choose.;;;;;;;;

3822;(Rave Master);Haru Glory;Is fighting right, or wrong? Does winning in the end mean justice? Truthfully, I don't know. But I know we must fight this battle! Or we will never save the world.;;;;;;;;

3833;(Kimi no Iru Machi);Haruto Kirishima;The more exciting it was to meet, the sadder it feels to say goodbye, right?;;;;;;;;
3834;(Devil Survivor 2);Yamato Hotsuin;Our world is like a terminal cancer. Saying you'll change things through individual will is rambling of a peace-loving fool.;;;;;;;;
3835;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Winry Rockbell;There are some things that can only be conveyed through words.;;;;;;;;
3836;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);King Bradley;The life of each human is worth one life, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.;;;;;;;;
3837;(Shiki);Sunako Kirishiki;If I was the protagonist in this story, I'm sure someone would come save me. It would be like a miracle. But I have no one to save me. There is no god who would grant me a miracle. I'm a murderer, after all. But I've done nothing bad. All I did was feed myself. If I hadn't, I would have starved to death. Would it have been better that way? Am I evil because I didn't let myself starve to death? Give me an answer, Muroi-san! I didn't willingly become such a creature. But if I have a life, shouldn't I treasure it? Is that a sin? Muroi-san! This is what it means to be abandoned by God.;;;;;;;;
3838;(School Rumble);Kenji Harima;The moment of one's confession, is the moment of another's dumping.;;;;;;;;
3839;(Phantom: Requiem For The Phantom);Ein;Dreams are illusions. All they do is interfere with reality.;;;;;;;;
3840;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;I want you to understand something. If you should lose, not only does your future end, but also the future of the one you are trying to protect. Defeat isn't an option for the sword that protects others. You should keep that thought engraved in your heart.;;;;;;;;
3841;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;It is foolish to listen to one who will not listen to you. Do as you wish.;;;;;;;;
3842;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;Why do people lie? It isn't only because they struggle against each other, it's also because there is something that they're seeking.;;;;;;;;

3844;(Hellsing);Alexander Anderson;*to Alucard* Demons do not cry... You became a demon, because you couldn't cry anymore, right? Humans cry, and when their tears finally run dry, there is nothing left, but a demon, nor a monster, and one finally prayer for death...;;;;;;;;

3849;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;I can't stray from my path for those I've left behind.;;;;;;;;
3850;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Ryuuguu Rena;Friends are nothing more than the people who you spend the fun, yet meaningless times with. When those times get rough, they aren't there to support you.;;;;;;;;
3851;(Naruto);Sai;It's because Sakura loves Sasuke that she doesn't want him to sink any lower. It's because she loves him that she wants to rescue him from the evil path he currently walks. Even if the only way to do it is to kill him with her own two hands, I believe, she's prepared to do it because she loves him.;;;;;;;;
3852;(School Rumble);Kenji Harima;Even though one is dumped, no matter how one shows his misfortune and seeks kindness, the world doesn't give a damn about it.;;;;;;;;

3854;(Guilty Crown);Inori Yuzuriha;You might be able to do it if you try. But if you don't try, you definitely can't.;;;;;;;;
3855;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;Cherry blossoms in Spring. Stars cover the sky on Summer. Full moon shines on Autumn and in Winter, the snow covers the ground. All these things make sake taste good. If it tastes bad, it's because there is something wrong in you.;;;;;;;;
3856;(Beelzebub);Hajime Kanzaki;You can't keep something without fighting for it.;;;;;;;;
3857;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;We shouldn't blame ourselves for bad things that happened to us. Sometimes, no matter what we do, we are victims of the circumstances. We should just have to pull ourselves out.;;;;;;;;

3859;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;Murder is the only art a swordsman may practice. No ornamental words can change that. You want to protect people with murder? You'll slaughter legions so that a few may live. Many years, long before you were born, my sword was tearing asunder the lives of men. Yes, all of those men were evil, but they were human beings first and foremost, Kenshin. The world you ardently desire to enter will not know what to do with you. It will deceive you into believing that you are saving lives even as you destroy them. You will accept these lies all the while, your hands will be stained with the worst of offenses.;;;;;;;;
3860;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;The dead don't desire revenge, but the happiness of the living.;;;;;;;;
3861;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;There are things that cannot be taken back. But the world will keep on spinning whether you laugh or you cry. High school life will eventually end too.;;;;;;;;
3862;(Fate/zero);Rider;Here, my armies once rode across the land. The place all the heroes who stood with me, through joy and sorrow, will never forget. I can make this world real because it still exists within our hearts! Behold my endless armies! Their bodies destroyed, and their souls offered to the world as Heroic Spirits. And still, these legendary heroes pledge their loyalty to me! My bond with them is my greatest treasure, my path of kingship! The ultimate Noble Phantasm that I, Iskandar, possess. Ionian Hetairoi!;;;;;;;;
3863;(Fate/stay night);Kotomine Kirei;It is a simple story. There is nothing that brings me happiness. It does not matter, let it be believing in people or having people believe in me. What other people called happiness did not bring me any joy. ;;;;;;;;

3870;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;This era is not so simple that you can put everything on your shoulders and be the only sacrifice. And, at the same time, one person's happiness isn't that simple, either. If you should fall as a sacrifice, one girl who came to Kyoto with the one wish to see you will definitely face misfortune. Remember that. No matter how strong you get, you are just a human being. There is no need for you to either become Buddha, or a murderer.;;;;;;;;
3871;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kaoru Kamiya;Everyone has a past they wish to erase.;;;;;;;;

3875;(Fate/zero);Rider;I suppose having your name recorded in the history books is a form of immortality. But if that just means your name gets passed down for two thousand years and nothing else, I'd have preferred to have even a hundredth of that added to my actual life.;;;;;;;;
3876;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;How does one figure out if they're in love with a member of the opposite sex?;;;;;;;;
3877;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;When one person kills, resentment is born. That resentment makes a person kill again. To sever that vicious cycle--that is the purpose of this sword that cannot kill.;;;;;;;;

3886;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;"""The important thing is to take part."" Famous words spoken by Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin during a speech. However, this quote tends to be frequently misused and serves as kind of a threat to force participation. There are tons of wild-goose chases in this world, y'know. If the most important thing is to take part, then surely one could find meaning in not taking part as well. And if everything's worth experiencing, then there's little doubt that the feeling of not experiencing something is, in itself, worth experiencing. In fact, you could even call it a valuable experience to not experience something everyone else does.";;;;;;;;

And compared to something as big as that, Al, you and I are tiny, not even the size of ants. Only one small part within a much greater flow. Nothing more than a fraction of the whole. But by putting all those ""ones"" together, you get one great ""All"", just like Teacher said.

;;;;;;;;;;;
3895;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;Humans can possibly exist without actually having to fight. But, many of us have chosen to fight. For what reason? To protect something? Protect what? Ourselves? The future? If we kill people to protect ourselves and this future, then what sort of future is it, and what will we have become? There is no future for those who have died. And what of those who did the killing? Is happiness to be found in a future that is grasped with blood stained hands? Is that the truth?;;;;;;;;

3905;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;"I've been thinking about this for a long time. We put all our trust in alchemy but in the end... what is it? ""Alchemy is the science of understanding the flow of matter and its laws. The process of comprehension, deconstruction, and reconstruction. The world flows too. It must also follow laws. Everything circulates. Even death is a part of that circulation. You must accept the flow."" Hmm, Teacher sure drummed that into our heads, didn't she? I thought I understood it. But I don't understand anything... Mom proves that. Now here I am again, trying desperately to figure out a way to do the impossible. I'm such a hopeless idiot.

3976;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;If you're looking at a single withered tree, it can seem like a big wound to the forest.

4033;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;This body comes with many inconveniences. But inconveniences don't make me miserable! There is no reason for you to pity me! My life was put back together with alchemy by my brother. If I deny myself, that would mean I'm denying my brother, along with alchemy. I believe in the potential that alchemy holds. I want to believe in it!;;;;;;;;
4034;(Naruto);Jiraiya;A person grows up when he's able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things that a person must learn on his own.;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
4037;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Is it wrong to do stuff by yourself? If someone worked hard on their own until now, why do they have to face rejection here?;;;;;;;;
4038;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;I am who I am and there is nothing wrong with that. The days continue like they always have, bringing neither excessive desire nor despair, nothing's changed. Yet I'm overwhelmed by this sense of fulfillment. I'm over here, you're over there. If I'm your savior, then you're mine.;;;;;;;;
4039;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Satou Tatsuhiro;No human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings.;;;;;;;;
4040;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;People who can't throw something important away, can never hope to change anything.;;;;;;;;
4041;(Denpa Kyoushi);Kagami Junichirou;Live by your own rules. And have reality accept your own rules. If you are able to do that, the future is all yours.;;;;;;;;
4042;(Sket Dance);Fujisaki Yusuke;I bet it's not easy to persevere in one's goal. I never tried, so I wouldn't know. But to achieve a goal, one must work hard even when no one is looking. Having a dream might not be all that great.;;;;;;;;
4043;(Baccano!);Victor Talbot;"Imagine what'd happen if I let someone like you loose on a bunch of politicians and scientists. You'd have them brainwashed in three days flat. First, you'd whisper your promises into their ears, getting them interested, and before they knew it, they'd be eating out of your goddamn hand. One of those scientists would say, ""Hey, this Huey fella, I think he's a really swell guy. We should talk to him and see what sort of information he might share with us"". And you can bet your ass by that point his brain would already be dribbling out his ears. Then oh, look, a strap on your straight jacket came loose, and oh, the next day they walk in and find out everyone in the lab is dead, and oh, Huey fucking Laforet is nowhere to be fucking seen! Oh no, oh what ever shall we fucking do Mr. Talbot, please do something even though you told us this exact thing was going to happen and we ignored you like the fucking idiots we are... and then they'll try and get me to find you, but you know what? I'll say no! Lemme say that again! No! Once more for good measure! Read my lips! Enn! Oh! No!";;;;;;;;
4044;(Devil Survivor 2);Hibiki Kuze;Everybody's weak. That's why we rely on others. We live by helping one another. We can say, we need one another. I've been able to survive because I have you and the others.;;;;;;;;
4045;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;The human mind is uncertain things. Within mind, even contradictory thoughts may coexist.;;;;;;;;
4046;(Fate/zero);Rider;When you someday find a way of life that you can truly be proud of, you'll be forced into your own battle whether you like it or not.;;;;;;;;
4047;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Lust;Memories... of the people we were. They're subtle, but they're real. It took me a lot of time to understand what I saw. Books say we shouldn't have memories. Or at least that they're only the memories and emotions of the alchemists who made us. But they are wrong. Those memories are mine.;;;;;;;;
4048;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;But you're thinking on too large a scale there, kid... If we don't want to drive ourselves crazy, we can only deal with what's directly in front of us.;;;;;;;;
4049;(Denpa Kyoushi);Kagami Junichirou;Educating a heterosexual person about anime, is a joy for an otaku.;;;;;;;;
4050;(Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Hakairoku Hen);Hyoudou Kazutaka;If you ever reach the point where you need to pray, you're already a failure of a man. ;;;;;;;;
4051;(Beelzebub);Shinobu Takamiya;"In manga, there's always a character who gets a sudden boost of power, right? Usually, it's when they're driven into a corner. Readers actually call it a ""convenient power up"", but it actually does happen in the real world as well. We humans only truly show our mettle when we're pushed into a corner.";;;;;;;;
4052;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Satou Tatsuhiro;Being alone is best. I mean, it's true, isn't it? In the end you'll be absolutely alone;;;;;;;;
4053;(Hyouka);Satoshi Fukube;A database can't draw conclusions.;;;;;;;;
4054;(Beelzebub);Tatsumi Oga;Crying is the same thing as pouring all your frustations and regrets out of your body. You may use it as a weapon, but that's just too easy. Whenever you feel like crying, just smile instead. That's what it means to be a man. You get it?;;;;;;;;
4055;(Beelzebub);Hildegard;Humans are so voracious, though. They eat everything from plants to animals... almost as if they think they are the top living creature to roam the earth. No being is more full of themselves as the humans.;;;;;;;;
4056;(Fate/zero);Rider;The inferiority you feel is actually the quality of a king. You may grumble a lot, but you know how small you are. And yet you still struggle to reach heights greater than you can imagine.;;;;;;;;
4057;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Even when our eyes are closed, there's a whole world out there, that lives outside of ourselves and our dreams.;;;;;;;;
4058;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Lust;Maybe you are right. Where did I come from and where will I go? When I die? Maybe all this time that is what I wanted: the freedom to find out.;;;;;;;;
4059;(Fullmetal Alchemist);King Bradley;You think surrendering, and offering yourself will stop the war? How arrogant. The life of each human is worth one, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.;;;;;;;;
4060;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Father;When you notice an insect on the ground, do you stop to consider it a fool? The life of an insect is so beneath you that it would be a waste of your time to even consider judging it. That would be an accurate summation of my feelings towards you, humans.;;;;;;;;
4061;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Riza Hawkeye;If the ways of this world are based on equivalent exchange, as alchemy says, then in order to allow for a new generation to enjoy good fortune, the price that we must pay, is to carry the bodies of the dead across a river of blood.;;;;;;;;
4062;(Gintama);Kotarō Katsura;Love is based on unpredictable events.;;;;;;;;
4063;(Fate/zero);Rider;Using a simple method to accomplish something impressive, far outshines using a complex method to achieve the same thing.;;;;;;;;
4064;(Durarara!!);Seiji Yagiri;A name has nothing to do with loving someone.;;;;;;;;
4065;(Gantz);Gantz;Fear beyond rational limits, forces people to cling to normality.;;;;;;;;
4066;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;On the day we left, we burned down the family home and all the familiar things inside. Because some memories aren't meant to leave traces.;;;;;;;;
4067;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;[To Envy] Now I see. You're Jealous. You're jealous of humans, aren't you? According to you, humans are supposed to be a lot weaker than Homunculi. And yet, even if they get discouraged after being beaten, and even if they get close to falling down after losing their paths, they continue to get up and fight. Everyone around them helps them get back up. And you're envious of that.;;;;;;;;
4068;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Miles;The death of a culture, is the death of a people.;;;;;;;;
4069;(Fairy Tail);Ultear Milkovich;"The time known as ""LIFE"", cannot be rewound.";;;;;;;;

4072;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;I want to see the splendor of people's souls.;;;;;;;;
4073;(Baccano!);Gustav St. Germain;Cast aside the illusion that there is a beginning and end to the story. The story has no beginning. And it has no end. All there is, is a performance of people connecting, living, influencing each other, and departing.;;;;;;;;
4074;(Baccano!);Ladd Russo;You don't have any power or technique like Jack Johnson or Jack Dempsey either! You know any boxer names? You know I'm right? If you're an American, of course you know! If you say you don't know, or something, I won't forgive you! I will never forgive you! And even if you know them, I still won't forgive you, though!;;;;;;;;
4075;(CANAAN);Maria Oosawa;Canaan is still alive. Her existence is shining so brightly. Too bright for the naked eyes to look at directly... I'm a bit scared, but I want to touch it. I want to touch her radiance. ;;;;;;;;
4076;(CANAAN);Siam;Canaan. You're a victim whose past was taken away by war. And she's a defeated person who lost her past in a power struggle. Soldiers who are born within destruction, take hatred as their weapon. Even though you and her became soldiers for the same reason, you both live differently. Listen Canaan, you cannot counter hatred with hatred... ever. ;;;;;;;;
4077;(Soul Eater);Crona;Trusting someone not to hurt you... how idiotic is that?;;;;;;;;

4079;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Amamiya Yuuko;Breaking a bond is every bit as painful as being physically torn apart. Can you endure that?;;;;;;;;
4080;(Baccano!);Graham Specter;Let me tell you an incomprehensible story! What is it for the actions of men to be incomprehensible? It would seem to me that if it can't be comprehended, one should not even bother trying. It is useless to even think about it, I think. That said, I don't know exactly what's going on but may we continue fighting please?;;;;;;;;
4081;(MAGI: The Labyrinth Of Magic);Ren Hakuryuu;Hatred will never be erased! The only thing you can do... is erase the ones you hate!;;;;;;;;
4082;(Baccano!);Ladd Russo;"Let me tell you how important it is to keep your mouth shut. Me, I've seen so many damn people going on and on about ""these will be the last words you ever hear"" and ""take these words with you to the afterlife"", and then that gives whoever they're fighting an opening to strike back. Crazy, isn't it? I see it all the time, in books, in plays, even in real life! I don't even know why, but somehow the more comfortable someone is with killing, the more they flap their mouth when it comes time to do the deed, yakking on and on and on. As you might have guessed, I myself happen to be such a person! And therefore, as such, in light of that revelation, I'll say that one is enough, and since that one is of course myself, I want you all to shut up. You're boring. Swallow those words and take them to the afterlife yourself, if you want them delivered there so damn much.";;;;;;;;
4083;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;[Talking to Riki] We've spent time together that made our hearts dance. But every story has to come to an end. No one can stay a kid forever. Time passes, and people grow up. There will come a day when we will no longer be together.;;;;;;;;
4084;(Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?);Ayumu Aikawa;There are a few things that people can't avoid while they live. People can't avoid misfortune. There are lots of hard things in life. There might even be times when you want to die.;;;;;;;;
4085;(Kimi ni Todoke);Sawako Kuronuma;There's no knowing how others are feeling unless you ask them. And your feelings can't get through to others unless you tell them directly.;;;;;;;;
4086;(Kanashimi no Belladonna);Jeanne;No... this is wrong! Didn't I fall into hell? This can't be hell! Surrendering my body to the devil, I should have become a wrinkled hag! My hair should be full of hateful snakes, my skin should be the color of a vile frog's! And my blood should be burning with the jet black flames of my grudge..! A lie. This form, it's a lie! I've been tricked! I wanted to become a terrifying woman, one that just a look from, would send anyone running. I have to be such a woman! I don't want to forget my anger and hate!;;;;;;;;
4087;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Father;You can't change reality, just your perception!;;;;;;;;
4088;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Trisha Elric;You see, I'm sure we can change, because we're weak. And because we die. We have to fight in order to live, and that is what will make us strong.;;;;;;;;
4089;(Fullmetal Alchemist);King Bradley;"Open your eyes. ""God"" is nothing more than a construct created by man to inspire fear and promote order.";;;;;;;;
4090;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;No matter how messed up things get, you can always figure out the best solution.;;;;;;;;
4091;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Pride;Appearances rarely share the whole truth.;;;;;;;;
4092;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Envy;Don't kid yourself, Mustang. You know how humans love to watch other people suffer while making fools of themselves. I mean, why else would you constantly be at war with each other?;;;;;;;;
4093;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alex Louis Armstrong;Destruction and creation are two sides of the same coin! You must destroy to create! That is the law of the universe!;;;;;;;;
4094;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Olivier Mira Armstrong;Love for the dead is pointless. We fight to keep them alive, that is all.;;;;;;;;
4095;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Yoshii Akira;It's all right to grieve over your defeat. It's important to admit when you've lost. Not being able to do so makes it impossible for you to climb back up after a fall, and even more impossible, for you to move forward. So go on ahead and grieve to your heart's extent. But after you're done grieving, be sure to set your eyes upon your next goal and move towards it.;;;;;;;;
4096;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;A peaceful every day life hides its fragility. Fear and violence aren't just something in another world, completely unrelated to us. If a disaster happens, we can't change it. But as long as we small gears are linked together, we can keep moving forward, even if it's only one small step at a time.;;;;;;;;
4097;(Devil May Cry);Dante;What would you ask for if you could have your wishes granted? Would you ask to be rich? Or to have the woman you're in love with be yours?  You can wish for whatever you want, it's your business, but to have one's wishes come true always comes with a price. Every deal has a catch. You'd better be nice and careful.;;;;;;;;
4098;(CANAAN);Maria Oosawa;I believe there are many things in this world that people haven't seen yet. If you really want to see something, there's nothing you can't see. You can't see it because you're closing your eyes on purpose. Because if you use your eyes to see it, it'll be painful, and sad. That's why they're closed in the first place. I think photography is like borrowing someone else's eyes. So even if your eyes are closed... you can borrow someone else's.;;;;;;;;
4099;(Bokura ga Ita);Bokura ga Ita;It's not that you can fall in love with someone new because you forgot the old. It's because you fall in love with someone new, that you're able to forget about the old. Only love can heal a heart that was hurt by love.;;;;;;;;

4107;(Tamako Market);Kunio Yaobi;There are some things you can gain by letting some things go. Happiness isn't just what you have here and now.;;;;;;;;
4108;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;Anything can happen. No one ever thinks it will until it does. What will happen, happens. That's how the world is. The most important thing is to not let the tragedy defeat you. To believe that you can get through it.;;;;;;;;
4109;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Yoshii Akira;Effort is nothing but a means to an end. Being proud of the fact that you tried is just putting the carriage before the horse.;;;;;;;;
4110;(One Piece);Trafalgar Law;The weak don't get to decide anything, not even how they die.;;;;;;;;
4111;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Greed;You want to bring back someone that you've lost. You might want money. Maybe you want women. Or, you might want to protect the world. These are all common things people want. Things that their hearts desire. Greed may not be good, but it's not so bad, either. You humans think greed is just for money and power! But everyone wants something they don't have.;;;;;;;;
4112;(Baccano!);Gustav St. Germain;Depending on who you place in the same situation, the characteristics of said incident change kaleidoscopically. In other words, there is one incident;;;;;;;;
4113;(Baccano!);Claire Stanfield;It doesn't matter who I am. You can just think of me as the talking air.;;;;;;;;
4114;(Baccano!);Ladd Russo;Now, dear Uncle, there's a certain person that I'd just love to kill. It doesn't even matter whether they're weak or strong. The people I live to kill, that really get me jazzed... never see it coming. Never. They're in some happy place where they're sure nothing can get them. Dying is the furthest thing from their minds. Maybe they're thinkin' about what they're gonna have for dinner. Just like you were. Right before I walked in.;;;;;;;;
4115;(Baccano!);Graham Specter;[to Chane] Sorry about this, young lady, but not being able to verbalize might be a lucky break for you in a way. People can waste an awful lot of energy by putting sadness into words. Or maybe joy into words. And then of course, there's putting anger into words. And the words can double when it comes to fear or pain. In that sense, being so afraid that you can't find any words may save your life. Being unable to speak in extreme stress, in a body that is obligated to control energy consumption, is an act of, OH, I don't know, maybe, self defense? Oh boy, I went and said a thing of actual intelligence there. Time to show me some love, boys!;;;;;;;;
4116;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;This world is merciless, and it's also very beautiful.;;;;;;;;
4117;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Nino;The whale leaps. As high as he can imagine. Piercing the water from peak to peak. Is a yearning for the sky reflected in his eyes? What if this high point wasn't merely the sky, but something far higher? If he knew of the infinite glitter of the stars, would his dreams soar even higher? Even if one doesn't know why, to live is to constantly reach out. Not to a nervous restlessness, but to a constant motion of the heart.;;;;;;;;
4118;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Kou Ichinomiya;First, we are born in the same galaxy. Born of the same species. Our lifetimes overlap. The meetings between humans are so unlikely as to be miraculous. To laugh, to cry, and to fall in love... Everyone is made up of a collection of 1% chances. Thus, I'm dazzled by the fact that there are so many miracles in this world.;;;;;;;;
4119;(Dragon Ball);Grand Elder Guru;Death is simply another stage of our life.;;;;;;;;

4121;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;If you can't get along without putting someone else down, it can't be real friendship.;;;;;;;;
4122;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;No point in wondering who someone really is, all you can do is trust them and accept them for who they are. Because the person you come to know is who that person really is.;;;;;;;;
4123;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;Power comes in response to a need, not a desire. You have to create that need.;;;;;;;;
4124;(Berserk);Griffith;It is my perception, that a true friend never relies on another's dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend, must be able to find his reason for life without my help. And, he would have to put his heart and soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal on those terms.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4126;(Berserk);Godo;If you desire one thing for so long, it's a given that you'll miss other things along the way. That's how it is... that's life.;;;;;;;;

4128;(MAGI: The Labyrinth Of Magic);Aladdin;Destiny isn't something to make you as you're told. By overcoming difficulties, life and this whole world can advance forward. That's what destiny is for. A world that has lost the power to advance forward, will be destroyed.;;;;;;;;
4129;(Gantz);Gantz;Humans believe their lives and ants lives are weighted differently. This is profound arrogance.;;;;;;;;
4130;(CLANNAD);Furukawa Nagisa;Life can bring lots of hardships, but it's always important to keep in mind that there are people around you who care for you, and are willing to help you through whatever you're dealing with.;;;;;;;;
4131;(CLANNAD);Fujibayashi Ryou;If a prediction is right, then it's like you only have one future. Like that future has been decided. But if it's wrong, then you have an almost infinite number of possibilities. And that means that even the tiniest twist of fate can change your future. I want to believe that I have choices - that the path I walk has many different turns, and many different roads to follow!;;;;;;;;
4132;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Yoshino Takigawa;Lovers don't need words to communicate.;;;;;;;;
4133;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;The people who have the ability to change something in this world, all, without exception, have guts to abandon things important to them if they have to.;;;;;;;;

4146;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Kaoru Yamazaki;People like us aren't qualified to be involved in a dramatic incident such as a suicide. No matter how depressed you are or how much pain you're in, you have to return to your routine, daily life. Even if you don't come back, you'll just end up dying in vain.

The second I spotted them, I put a lid on the tin and ran away. In other words, I kidnapped them. Is there any way to spin this? I mean, any way to solve the problem? ;;;;;;;;

4216;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;What does it mean to be reborn? That isn't the life I had anymore. It's someone else's life. Everyone only gets to live life one time [Yuri places her hand on her chest.], and it's right here. I only get it once. This is my life. I can't entrust it to someone, I can't steal a new one, I can't force it on others, I can't forget it or erase it. I can't stomp over it, laugh at it, or beautify it! I can't anything! I'd have to accept my one shot at life no matter how cruel, merciless, or unfair I thought it was! Sir, don't you understand? That is why I must fight. I must keep on fighting!

When people judge somebody, it becomes a fixed idea and an impression that lasts. A loner is forced to stay a loner. If you do your best at something and stand out, that'll only get used as fodder for criticism. Those are the rules of the Kingdom of Children.;;;;;;;;
4219;(One Outs);Toua Tokuchi;Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.;;;;;;;;

4226;(Tenshi Nanka ja Nai);Nakagawa Ken;When I look up, I see a gloomy, cloudy sky. Today is another tiring uphill climb. I get sick of it all. Then... I think of the girl I love, and I put back on those worn down shoes. Her smile is like a ray of light that shines down from in between the clouds and warms up my heart. My girl has the smile of an angel.;;;;;;;;

4235;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;I can't lose against myself. There's no element that would make me lose if our powers are equal. To admit defeat against such an enemy is to declare that I'm wrong.;;;;;;;;

4241;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;"Youth is a hoax. It's evil. People who make a big deal of their ""youth"", are just inviting trouble. They try to keep everything going on around them. For them, if there's something that has to do with their ""youth"", they jump at it without a second thought. From normal daily life, to rebelling against the view of society. If you fall in with them - lies, secrets, failure, and even crimes await you. But for them, it's just a spice of life. And if failure is also a mark of ""youth"", then isn't it ironic, that a person who failed to make any friends, is also technically leading his ""youth""? Though I wonder if they would agree. Everything runs on their schedule. Let me be clear. The people who enjoy their ""youth"", will eventually fall apart.                 ";;;;;;;;

4247;(Psycho-Pass);Nobuchika Ginoza;Hey, it's been a while. I came to talk to you today, since I decided what I'm going to do next. My Crime Coefficient went up to 140. There's no longer a chance for recovery. But it's not in my nature to sit around and mope in the isolation facility. So I decided to go back to where I used to work. You told me to take a different path. Guess I didn't live up to your expectations. I'm a bad son in every respect, aren't I? But strangely enough, I have no regrets. There's nothing good about being a detective. Even so, it's a job that someone needs to do. Right, dad?;;;;;;;;
4248;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;Forgive my rudeness, but to hide your true self and make a vain display... I think that's just running away from reality.

4253;(Another);Mei Misaki;Death is not friendly. It's dark, black where you look at it. You're all alone. But it's no different when you're alive, right? No matter how many relationships we seem to have, we're all alone.;;;;;;;;
4254;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;"""Trust"". The act is without a doubt a very noble one. But you know, what many people call ""trust"" is actually giving up on trying to understand others. And that has nothing to do with ""trust"", but is rather apathy.";;;;;;;;
4255;(Fate/stay night);Tohsaka Rin;Those who aim further for other's sake. Those who think of others before themselves. ...And those who hate themselves more than anyone. These are the qualities of a Magus. This is a contradiction you can only have if you are born broken.;;;;;;;;

4263;(FLCL);Naota Nandaba;When you're in a town like this, all covered with smoke - you forget that there's a world outside. Nothing amazing happens here. And you get used to that. Used to a world where everything is ordinary. Every day we spend here is like a whole lifetime of dying slowly. But now Haruko is here. That's how I know there really is a world outside.;;;;;;;;
4264;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;When we were still in the world of living, death was something that came indiscriminately and randomly. So, there was no way to fight it.;;;;;;;;
4265;(Angel Beats!);Iwasawa;I heard that when things were painful for her, she'd cover her ears with headphones and escape to the world of music. I tried it too. It was like everything was blown away. The vocals screamed for me. They grieved for me. The ones who put on the act of common sense were wrong. Those who cried were right. We, the lonely were more human. They screamed at the absurd, beat it down, and destroyed it. They saved me.;;;;;;;;

4268;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Kamijou Touma;"Things like heroes are unnecessary. Can't you save someone if you're standing right there, at that very spot? In front of your eyes are people that don't wish to cry that are crying!

4269;(Gintama);Kagura;It hasn't withered. I won't let it wither. We might just be little branches, but if the branches break off, the tree really will wither. That's why I won't break off.

4271;(Fairy Tail);Mirajane Strauss;I don't think it's completely such a bad thing to cling to one single person, but you have any number of people all around you. People are always connected to one another. You see? Just reach out your hand, and there's someone right here. It's when people realize how lonely it is being on their own, that they start to become kind.;;;;;;;;

4277;(Arakawa Under the Bridge);Kou Ichinomiya;If there is a creator, he surely made this world too large. This is inconvenient for us small, fearful humans. For all the world's vastness, we can't measure the distance between ourselves. There are 6 billion of us, yet still, everyone is alone. That is why we are all frantically searching for that one person we need no distance from.;;;;;;;;

4288;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;Inside my memories lies sad thoughts and it's hard to forget, but I try everyday to keep moving forward in life, so why can't you, living in saddness isn't living at all.;;;;;;;;
4289;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Do not think about other things, there is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing. Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you, yourself, are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image.;;;;;;;;

4298;(Liar Game);Akiyama Shinichi;Doubt them. Question them, suspect them... and take a good, long look into their hearts. Humans are the kind of beings that can't put their pain into words, after all.;;;;;;;;

4301;(Gekkou);Samejima Mirai;There must be something wrong with those that are delighted about other people's happiness. Every one of them is either a hypocrite or just scheming something.;;;;;;;;
4302;(Gekkou);Tsukimori Youko;If you are afraid to get hurt, you won't obtain what you really desire.;;;;;;;;
4303;(Gekkou);Nonomiya;Life's interesting because there's a limit to it. The thrill of not knowing when it ends is what gives you the awareness of being alive.;;;;;;;;
4304;(Gekkou);Konan;Choosing another way of life means throwing away all you've done so far and becoming a new self...;;;;;;;;
4305;(Spice and Wolf);Mark;Poets say love can't be bought with money. Preachers say that there are things more important than money. So even though we work hard just to earn money, how can we obtain something more important than that?;;;;;;;;

4312;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;I want to see and understand the world outside. I don't want to die inside these walls without knowing what's out there! ;;;;;;;;
4313;(Gintama);Kirara;I think that in the end, I just care a lot about myself. I was the only one that I loved and respected. That's why I was scared to know what the others thought about me. I was afraid to get hurt, so I ran away and locked myself into my shell.;;;;;;;;
4314;(Gintama);Obi Hajime;Tears are handy for washing away troubling and sad feelings. But when you grow up, you'll learn that there are things so sad, they can never be washed away by tears. That there are painful memories that should never be washed away. So people who are truly strong laugh when they want to cry. They endure all of the pain and sorrow while laughing with everybody else.;;;;;;;;
4315;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Trying to shoulder the burden all by yourself? Don't be a stranger. Weep and ask for help. Lean on me with your runny nose. Cry when you feel like crying. Laugh when you feel like laughing. When you're tearing up with an ugly face, I'll give you a good cry with an uglier face. When you're laughing so hard your stomach hurts, I'll laugh in a louder voice. That's how it should be. It's far better to get dirty while living true to yourself, than to throw away yourself and die a clean death.;;;;;;;;

I have a wide range of acceptance when it comes to women: not just fallen female main characters, but also foster sisters, foster mothers, foster daughters, twins, widows, senpais, fellow classmates, teachers, childhood friends, ojousamas, blondes, brunettes, brown-haired, silver-haired, long-haired, medium-haired, short-haired, girls wearing bobby pins, wavy-haired, twintails, ponytails, one-sided ponytails, twin braids, ahoges, curly-haired, girls in sailor clothes, blazers, kindergarten nurses, maids, policewomen, witches, shrine maidens, nuns, military women, secretaries, lolis, shotas, tsunderes, cheerleaders, stewardesses, waitresses, goth girls wearing black, goth girls wearing white, girls in China dresses, frail girls, albino girls, fantasists, girls with split personalities, queens, princesses, thigh-high socks, garterbelts, girls who cross-dress as guys, girls who wear glasses, girls who wear an eye-patch, girls who wear bandages, girls in school swimsuits, one-piece swimsuits, bikinis, V-shaped bikinis, bikinis that barely cover anything, ghosts, animal-eared girls, etc.- any female is within my area of acceptance.;;;;;;;;
4325;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Miyazaki Ryuu;A lie yields hope when you realize it's a lie. On the other hand, when you feel that a cruel fact is reality, you fall into despair all the more.;;;;;;;;
4326;(Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria);Oomine Daiya;No matter what you do, no matter where you go, you can't get away from your nature.;;;;;;;;
4327;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Eternity is instantaneous, and an instant is eternal.;;;;;;;;
4328;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Kouta Tsuchiya;...A human's belief can make the impossible possible.;;;;;;;;
4329;(Fairy Tail);Rob;Freedom can be found at the bottom of your heart.;;;;;;;;
4330;(Sora no Otoshimono: Forte);Sakurai Tomozo;Who cares? Who cares if they're human or if they're something else? If they have boobs, what's the problem?;;;;;;;;
4331;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;I decided to stop calling out for someone who would never call back.;;;;;;;;
4332;(Steins;;;;;;;;;;
4333;(Paradise Kiss);Yukari Hayasaka;He turns the black-and-white landscape into brilliant colors. That's what George was to me. Even if our paths don't ever cross again, that will never change. ;;;;;;;;
4334;(NANA);Nana Komatsu;Hey Nana, if Cinderella's glass slipper fits so perfectly, I wonder why it fell off along the way? I can't help but think that it was on purpose, to attract the prince's affections. No matter what I do, I'll still have the fate of a girl who just keeps getting hurt, wondering if she can be happy in this pointless, one man show?;;;;;;;;
4335;(Bokura ga Ita);Nanami Takahashi;Before meeting you, I didn't know what it was like to feel lonely. I never even considered myself to be alone. That's because when you feel lonely, it means that there is someone for you to miss.;;;;;;;;
4336;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;Don't give up, the beginning is always the hardest, so let's keep on going till the very end.;;;;;;;;
4337;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;That's the kind of people they are. Whether it was me or not doesn't make a difference. A person falling to their doom, and without a second thought they would jump in to save them. It's impossible to just sit and let it happen. Without thinking of the consequences their bodies just move. That's what kind of idiocy is gathered here. That's the Yorozuya. Even if you forget everything else, as long as you remember that much, we're good. As long as you remember that, whomever your leader is, you guys will do fine.;;;;;;;;
4338;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;In the shinobi world, those that break the written and unwritten rules are deemed trash... but be that as it may... Those that would desregard their comrades so easily are even worse than trash. And those who don't have the decency to respect the memories of their comrades are the worst.;;;;;;;;
4339;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Sometimes, forgetting is a type of happiness.;;;;;;;;
4340;(Immortal Rain);Machika Balfaltin;Somehow, the sea at night seems terribly dark. As if right beyond this point, the world might end.;;;;;;;;
"But I'm not afraid. Because mornings without you are much scarier.""";;;;;;;;;;;
4341;(Naruto);Might Guy;If you want to be free from your suffering, make up your mind. If you give up on your dream, you will suffer more.;;;;;;;;
4342;(Jormungand);Jormungand;I devour the five lands and drain the three seas, yet only the sky is impossible to reach. With this body lacking wings, hands, or legs. I am the World Serpent. My name is Jormungand. ;;;;;;;;
4343;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;Take it, that courage you have locked in your heart. Awaken it, wipe your tears, be strong and use that courage.;;;;;;;;
4344;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yoshida Haru;Clean up after yourself. If you want to be accepted, you must accept yourself first.;;;;;;;;
4345;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;Only victors are allowed to live... this world is merciless like that.;;;;;;;;
4346;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;[referring to a group of thugs] I disposed of some dangerous beasts. Mere animals that just happened to resemble humans.;;;;;;;;
4347;(Hunter X Hunter);Leorio Paladiknight;For the right price, you can buy not only treasures, but dreams, hearts and even people's lives!;;;;;;;;
4348;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;The voice, the smile that still remains in his heart... all of it was a long time ago. Humans live such short lives.;;;;;;;;
4349;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;We reset, and return to our separate lives. You can't reset your life, but you can reset your relationships.;;;;;;;;
4350;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I really am... shinobi trash. But the one thing I still learned is this. That void is something that everyone helps you fill. Just because you face adversity and hardships, is no reason to give up on this world. A person willing to throw away all those memories... of their friends and comrades, will never find peace of mind. Resorting to something like that isn't going to bury that hole. If you persevere and endure, someone will be there to support you!;;;;;;;;
4351;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Shizuka Hiratsuka;Didn't your mother ever tell you that mentioning a woman's age will get you killed? ;;;;;;;;
4352;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;You STILL don't get it? When you tossed all of that away, a few important things were discarded as well. You abandoned your friends? More like you were afraid of BEING abandoned. You fight by yourself? More like you hid yourself in solitude from the beginning. You abandoned yourself? No... You just couldn't bear the pain of having a heavy load place upon you, or being a heavy load, so you ran. Like the coward you are. If you want to live your life abandoning one thing after another, that's your choice. But to try to incite your student to join you because you can't handle being alone, makes you a fool.;;;;;;;;
4353;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;The only thing we're allowed to do... is to believe that we won't regret the choice we made.;;;;;;;;
4354;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;I've been through so many meetings and partings. They were like a heavy secret, but when I started to talk about them, they seemed to sparkle... I couldn't put them into words.;;;;;;;;
4355;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Mikasa Ackerman;If you think it's natural for people to sacrifice their own lives to save others, surely you understand that sometimes a single death can save many lives.;;;;;;;;
4356;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Armin Arlelt;The strong feed upon weak. It's such an obligingly simple rule. Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.;;;;;;;;
4357;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;You have three choices, you can give up, give in or give it your all.;;;;;;;;
4358;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;I won't run, I will stand and look ahead to what I must do, I must face the fear, I won't let it control me anymore, I will use my heart that holds my courage and my bravery to move me forward to what I must do.;;;;;;;;
4359;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sayaka Miki;Someone has to be cursed to balance out a wish for someone else's happiness. That's how we, magical girls, work.;;;;;;;;
4360;(Medaka Box);Medaka Kurokami;People do not exist to follow rules. Rules exist to protect the people.;;;;;;;;
4361;(Medaka Box);Kouki Akune;If you're going to make a wish, you must put forth the effort to ensure that it comes true!;;;;;;;;
4362;(Medaka Box);Myouri Unzen;If you claim to love humans, that should include their lies and betrayals, their sins and ugliness, their jealousy and immaturity, their hatred and conflicts.;;;;;;;;
4363;(Natsume Yuujinchou);Takashi Natsume;As I had encountered kindness, I wanted to be kind myself. I wanted to be able to do something, just like others had done for me.;;;;;;;;
4364;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;I wish I could go back to my childhood. It went by so quickly I feel like it was robbed from me.;;;;;;;;
4365;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. If you don't fight, you can't win!;;;;;;;;
4366;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;What is truly good about a person can't be expressed in words, that it can not. What matters is the feeling of trust one gets after spending time with him.;;;;;;;;
4367;(Kuroko No Basket);Teppei Kiyoshi;You keep working HARD in order to win and you get better little by little. To IMMERSE yourself in something you like, that's what it means to enjoy something fully.;;;;;;;;
4368;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;It's not the goodbyes that hurt, it's the flashbacks that follow...;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4371;(Ludwig Kakumei);Ludwig Kakumei;Real love... if such a thing existed, would not be something as stupid as a woman's looks or the size of her bust.;;;;;;;;
4372;(Air);Misuzu Kamio;This is the end of my dream. My wings forgot how to fly, since I only kept pretending to flap them. Is there a meaning to wings that can't fly?;;;;;;;;
4373;(Berserk);Guts;Even if we painstakingly piece together something lost, it doesn't mean things will ever go back to how they were.;;;;;;;;
4374;(Kakumeiki Valvrave);L-elf;Happiness isn't something you divide in halves.;;;;;;;;
4375;(Naruto);Gaara;In order to escape a road of solitude, one has to work hard, and forge a new path with their own power.;;;;;;;;
4376;(Starry Sky);Kanata Nanami;Since childhood, my body was weak. There was a limit to what I could do. A weak body... A life which I don't know how long I would live for. Well, life has its limits. I felt like my limit was exceeding faster than others' limit.;;;;;;;;
4377;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;When life changes to be harder, change yourself to be stronger.;;;;;;;;
4378;(Kuroko No Basket);Midorima Shintarou;Don't give up! There's no shame in falling down! True shame is to not stand up again!;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4380;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Levi Ackerman;This is just my opinion, but when it comes to teaching somebody discipline... I believe pain is the most effective way.;;;;;;;;
4381;(Fairy Tail);Wendy Marvell;If I haven't had fear, then I also wouldn't have been able to know what it's like to have bravery in my heart.;;;;;;;;
"Bravery that awakens when you're being consumed by fear.""";;;;;;;;;;;
4382;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;A strong person is not the one who doesn't cry. A strong person is the one who cries and sheds tears for a moment, then gets up and fights again.;;;;;;;;
4383;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;Feelings are connection. They surpass time, and find their way back to the people you love.;;;;;;;;
4384;(Welcome to the N.H.K);Satou Tatsuhiro;It's natural for a person to deny he's a failure as a human being. That's why he searches for somebody who is more miserable than himself. That's why so much animosity exists on the internet. Those who aren't able to find a more miserable person, turn to the internet and call other people losers, even though they've never met. Just to make themselves feel superior. Isn't that pathetic? There's a sense of security that comes from speaking badly of someone else. But that isn't true salvation.;;;;;;;;
4385;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;It's not like I'm pessimistic or anything... I'm just moving forward without looking back.;;;;;;;;
4386;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Rei Ayanami;Those who hate themselves, cannot love or trust others.;;;;;;;;
4387;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;I hate nice girls. Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't get fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you're nice to me, you're nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I always hate nice girls.;;;;;;;;
4388;(Fate/zero);Rider;Then you swear that, once I defeat an enemy, you will buy me pants?;;;;;;;;
4389;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;On that day, mankind received a grim reminder. We lived in fear of the titans, and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls. ;;;;;;;;
4390;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;We once fought together for an ideal with our swords. It wasn't for power or for glory, but to create a peaceful world where people could live without fear. And if you should forget about that, then what did we fight the revolution for? ;;;;;;;;
4391;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yoshida Haru;You can't pick up water once it's spilled, so handle it carefully.;;;;;;;;
4392;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;A person can change, at the moment when the person wishes to change.;;;;;;;;
4393;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;Somewhere inside of me?! Take a good look, there's nothing inside of me anymore!!! I don't feel pain, I don't feel anything! You need to let that guilt go Kakashi. This wind hole wasn't your doing... It was made by this evil, cruel world.;;;;;;;;
4394;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Everyone's carrying something that matters. You just don't realize when you're carrying it. It's only after it slips out of your hand that you realize how heavy it was in the first place. So many times I thought that I'd never carry a load like that ever again. And yet, before I realized it, I was carrying it again. I'd feel so much better if I just got rid of it. But I just can't bring myself to do it.;;;;;;;;
4395;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Tsunayoshi Sawada;I consider everything that happened to be precious moments of my life. The pain. The suffering. The fun… And I am here right now, because everyone was there for me. I couldn't have accomplished anything by standing still, without anybody's help. I treasure every moment I have spent here. Unlucky? I feel pretty lucky. This is my resolve.;;;;;;;;
4396;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;I am a supporting actor, a shadow. But a shadow will become darker if the light is stronger and it will make the white of the light stand out. As the shadow of the main actor, I will make you, the light, the number one in Japan.;;;;;;;;
4397;(Legend of the Galactic Heroes);Reinhard von Lohengramm;No matter the era, whichever the society, people always gaze at the stars when young. Then they stretch out their hands and try to catch them. And then one day, they realize their arms are not long enough to catch the stars, and that's when they grow up.;;;;;;;;
4398;(Great Teacher Onizuka);Eikichi Onizuka;You know, when I was in high school, I was a troublemaker. I hardly went to school. Before I knew it, I was expelled. When I couldn't go anymore, was when I first realized, that school was a great thing. There's a lot of friends and lots of fun things. When I got this old, I wanted even more to go to school. That's why I became a teacher. Because, if I become a teacher, I could stay in school until I die, right? That's why I'm really happy now. I want you to be like that too. I want you to like school. Once it's over, it's too late.;;;;;;;;
4399;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Family is other people. No matter how close your blood relationship is... no matter what your relationship may be... anyone other than you is not you! And so you have to think it over and decide for yourself! Take away other people's wants and needs, and decide if this is something that is necessary for you! It may cause hardships to others, but you want it. That's your free will right there! But you ignore that and decide based on someone else's advice, because decency demands it, because people say it's awful, you will fail and quit. No one could succeed that way! You don't understand what you're trying to do. With that as your background, how do you expect to make a promise to yourself? But the opposite way... there are risks there too, of course. If you decide to take the action that best suits you, there will be people who won't understand. People will be saddened by your actions.;;;;;;;;
4400;(Dragon Ball);Frieza;There are three things I cannot tolerate: cowardice, bad haircuts, and military insurrection. It is very unfortunate that our friend Vegeta possesses all three of these.;;;;;;;;
4401;(Kanon);Shiori Misaka;It would be enough for the depressing things in life to only exist in reality. It is because that I think the birth of a story is from people dreaming of a happy ending.  ;;;;;;;;
4402;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;We as humans have the power to do such, but whether we grab on to the thread or not is a choice we make.;;;;;;;;
4403;(Wolf's Rain);Spirit Owl;When are we born? When do we die? Why are we born? Why do we die? The world has been destroyed and we've fallen countless times, always resurrecting from the ashes as Paradise. It has happened before, and it will happen again. An endless cycle of life and death. The world is a Paradise that was opened by someone, but this era too is almost at an end. We have acquired the means to exceed our natural span of life, never suspecting that the world itself was finalized in its existence. This knowledge has left me in despair, my fate has fallen and scattered like the petals of a dying flower, like the blast from a sand storm it has been worn down and weathered away. As if to be purified, the world will be encased in ice so that it can return to the beginning once more. Paradise is a world that is opened by someone...  ;;;;;;;;
4404;(Eyeshield 21);Hiruma Youichi;If sorry could solve anything, we wouldn't have a need for the police. ;;;;;;;;
4405;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;Rumors, at times, can be more severe than the truth.;;;;;;;;
4406;(Hataraku Maou-sama!);Maou Sadao;I've never seen a hero fall down stairs, cry, and get first aid from demons.;;;;;;;;
4407;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;The choice we're making might be one of evil as well. For we call for peace, but with weapons in our hands. Nevertheless, allow us to break of endless conflict. Give us strength.;;;;;;;;
4408;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;Maybe it would be just like in the mangas. I'd tell him I love him and then we cut to the happy ending.;;;;;;;;
4409;(Gakuen Alice);Narumi Anjo;Life sometimes deals you a bad hand and you make a lot of mistakes along the way, but as long as you believe in yourself and walk along your chosen path with a smile, everything will be alright. ;;;;;;;;
4410;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Gendou Ikari;Mankind's greatest fear is Mankind itself.  ;;;;;;;;
4411;(Serial Experiments Lain);Arisu Mizuki;If you aren't remembered, then you never existed.;;;;;;;;
4412;(Fairy Tail);Mavis Vermillion;Unwavering Faith and Resilient Bonds will bring even miracles to your side.;;;;;;;;
4413;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;Just because it's illogical, that doesn't make it wrong.;;;;;;;;
4414;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Sanetoshi Watase;Let´s see how many people you can kill with the power of love.;;;;;;;;
4415;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;However, I can't be happy. I feel I can't have that experience, I can't assume I will have that experience. I'm free, but feeling lonely and disheartened. I hope there's happiness out there. Besides, the future is approaching and waiting for me. In the future, I will be a part of the world. I will finally live my life.  ;;;;;;;;
4416;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;Look what happens when you're not fast enough! You get CUT! It's more fun when it hurts a little bit though, isn't it?;;;;;;;;
4417;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Ritsu Onodera;Usually, he just abuses everyone. Normally, he's so sarcastic. But now he's holding me as if I were something precious.;;;;;;;;
4418;(Bakuman);Akito Takagi;"I think manga and life are the same thing. A weekly manga lasts for a week, and life lasts until you die. It's making the best of whatever time you're given. So, you can't hold back. ""Conceit"" and ""Luck"" are important, but the most important one is ""Hard Work"".";;;;;;;;
4419;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;You believe that the strong exist to cull the weak. To use them as food. But you are mistaken... The strong exist, not to feed off of the weak, but to protect them! ;;;;;;;;
4420;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;I want to believe that memories, even sad and painful ones, should not be forgotten forever.;;;;;;;;
4421;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Mami Tomoe;You shouldn't want to be like me, I'm... just trying to act cool. No matter how scary it is, how hard it is, I can't talk to anyone about it. I always cry alone. Being a Magical Girl isn't good at all.;;;;;;;;
4422;(Spice and Wolf);Horo;When a person lies, what is important is not the lie itself. No, it is their reason. Their why.;;;;;;;;
4423;(Shinsekai Yori);Shun Aonuma;We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.;;;;;;;;
4424;(Yami no Matsuei);Kazutaka Muraki;Because I love you, I want to rip you apart. I want to pile corpses before you.;;;;;;;;
4425;(Pokémon);Mewtwo;I now see that the circumstances of birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.;;;;;;;;
4426;(Hyouka);Satoshi Fukube;Even if I did win, it was boring. How can it be interesting unless you win in an interesting way?;;;;;;;;
4427;(Hyouka);Eru Chitanda;If you can never get angry at anything, that probably means you have nothing that you like, either.;;;;;;;;
4428;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Misawa Kyouko;Humans will wither away if they're always alone. The only remedy would be to seek out other people.;;;;;;;;
4429;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Yoshino Takigawa;But even if I acted sad over it, nothing would change. Even if I cry, nothing would change.;;;;;;;;
4430;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;The subtle light that is born when people's feelings come together. That light embraces felicity, evil, sin, and happiness. The light blazes forth... illuminating the whole truth.;;;;;;;;
4431;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;We don't know if this world is real or a dream. Maybe the world until now has been a convenient fake. But magic will probably disappear now. The dream is over.;;;;;;;;
4432;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Rejection makes a man stronger.;;;;;;;;
4433;(Fairy Tail);Mavis Vermillion;There are walls that can't be broken through power alone. But if there is a power that can break through those walls, it is the power of feelings.;;;;;;;;
4434;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;Once you've recognized your mistakes, it's easy enough to correct them.;;;;;;;;
4435;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Yoshino Takigawa;Miracles are irrational by nature.;;;;;;;;
4436;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.;;;;;;;;
4437;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;The actors on stage cannot ignore their scripts and do as they wish. If they make a beautiful exit, I feel they fulfill their role.;;;;;;;;
4438;(Accel World);Kuroyukihime;You are really red. It would be fun to hang you from a traffic light, and stop cars.;;;;;;;;
4439;(Chihayafuru);Ooe Kanade;A woman must always move with grace, whether you're wiping a table or drying sheets. Or in the fight for your life.;;;;;;;;
4440;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;I hate humans. I find the thought that I'm from the same species to be depressing.;;;;;;;;
4441;(Aah! Megami-Sama);Belldandy;People have the strength to overcome their obstacles – everyone can.;;;;;;;;
4442;(Revolutionary Girl Utena);Anthy Himemiya;You really don't know what happened, do you? It doesn't matter. By all means, stay in this cozy coffin of yours and continue to play prince. But I have to go now. She's not gone at all, she merely vanished form your world. Farewell.  ;;;;;;;;
4443;(Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood);Lust;Blood calls for blood, while hatred begets hatred, and the energy that comes forth begins to take root in this earth and engraves a crest of blood. They never learn, no matter how many times history is repeated. Humans are foolish, sorrowful creatures.;;;;;;;;
4444;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;Only sadness can counter sadness.;;;;;;;;
4445;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;It might be for the better if there are amusing people around me. Because any tragedy may seem a comedy, as long as I am with them.;;;;;;;;
4446;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Kenji Yamaguchi;If you can't give up one, learn to balance both at the same time. Why does it have to be all or nothing?;;;;;;;;
4447;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;Studying was fun. I enjoyed solving problems quickly, and I was rewarded for the effort I put in. Studying made me feel complete.;;;;;;;;
4448;(Aah! Megami-Sama);Celestin;The gods have, since ancient times, created methods to test humans. The system God has created... it opposes all living creatures and splits the world. It condemns people to roles. Heaven pretends they can't see the suffering of the people. Only the lucky few find the way. The pain of those beings reaches deep into my heart. I want to counter this discrimination and extend a helping hand. In order to do that, the only thing that can be done is to create a new system! See... this is what God has wrought... I cannot allow such a system to continue! This is the will of my quarrel with Heaven. I would like you to come with me. If I had your help, even the weak-of-heart could have their wishes fulfilled. So that everyone can be equal and happy, I wish to reach out.;;;;;;;;
4449;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Misawa Mitsuyoshi;Love is good. It changes people, for better or for worse. You could look at it as a chance for you to change. The best kind of love helps you grow up.;;;;;;;;
4450;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;The beginning is the end, and the end is the beginning. Well then, let us begin again. And to each, their own tale.;;;;;;;;
4451;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;"It most certainly isn't pleasant being called a ""traitor"" by creatures you've never met.";;;;;;;;
4452;(Haibane Renmei);Renmei Communicator;To know your sin is to have no sin.;;;;;;;;
4453;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;Nine-Tails, you are merely a momentary life, a temporary existence of coalesced energy... energy that once was a single, ultimate form! An unstable force, lacking in intelligence or sapience, you require a guide to show you purpose. That guide is the Uchiha! The tailed beasts are but slaves to those with blessed eyes. Obey!;;;;;;;;
4454;(Hellsing);Montana Max;"Very well. Then krieg(German for ""war"") is what you shall have. We are a clenched fist, ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might. But, after enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness, for us, a simple, ""ordinary"" war will no longer be sufficient. We need a massive war! A war beyond any other that man's history has ever known! We are but a single battalion, the remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong. However, I believe that each of you old warriors is worth a thousand of their sickly soft children! We represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men!";;;;;;;;
4455;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Sanetoshi Watase;"You see, there was this girl and she just appeared out of the blue. To my surprise, she was the same kind of person as me, and she had the same kind of eyes, at first sight, I realized I wasn't a solitary existence in this world, I was so happy. That's right, until I met her, I was all alone in this world, I had not a soul with whom to share the scenery before my eyes, and not a soul with whom to share the music in my ears. But...I heard the voices all over the world, I could hear the whole world crying out, ""save me"". It's true, thus I could see the optimal path of the world. But it saddened me, because the moment I saw her - I knew we were never meant to be, yes, she refused to side with me. She rejected me - the only person who could see the same scenery.";;;;;;;;
4456;(His and Her Circumstances);Soichiro Arima;People who know how painful it can be to be alive, are fascinating.;;;;;;;;
4457;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;At least in academics, you can control the outcome, whether it's good or bad.;;;;;;;;
4458;(Cowboy Bebop);Spike Spiegel;I felt like I was watching a dream I'd never wake up from. Before I knew it, the dream was all over.;;;;;;;;
4459;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Aside from the fact that I don't have any friends or girlfriends, I'm still a high quality product!;;;;;;;;
4460;(Bakuman);Akito Takagi;I don't mind the regret, if I fail in attempt to achieve my dreams. What I don't wanna regret is not chasing those dreams.;;;;;;;;
4461;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Eren Jaeger;If you think reality is just living comfortably and following your own whims, can you seriously dare to call yourself a soldier?;;;;;;;;
4462;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hakaze Kusaribe;When you do something for the man you love, instead of for the world, it's easier to decide what must be done. Ultimately, it's better to do things for someone rather than something.;;;;;;;;
4463;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;Hamlets mistake is that he believed in something like a ghost, that doesn't exist. The second he believed in something irrational, he was doomed. Those are just delusions imagined by the living. Once you're dead, that's it. The dead don't return, nor do they hear our wishes. It's all an illusion. Things you forgot to say, things you couldn't say... they want ghosts to hear them, so they dream one up. It's also possible that people imagine their desire as ghosts.;;;;;;;;
4464;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Yoshino Takigawa;A girlfriend isn't something you get just because you want one. You meet someone you like, and you want to spend time together. That's why you'd want that person as your girlfriend, right?;;;;;;;;
4465;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Aika Fuwa;Everything happens for a reason. The daily tragedies and misfortunes are all meaningful events, leading toward an ideal conclusion. With that in mind, there probably isn't really any meaningless misfortune.;;;;;;;;
4466;(Bakuman);Kazuya Hiramaru;Why do people have to work? I just want to eat and sleep. I should have born as a panda at the zoo.;;;;;;;;
4467;(Bakuman);Moritaka Mashiro;I prefer to be a humble dreamer, with visions to be realized, rather than the ruler of people with no dreams or desires.;;;;;;;;
4468;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Hachiman Hikigaya;Bears are creatures that feel no insecurity in living alone. They're an animal that lives in isolation. Plus, they can hibernate. What a fabulous thing that is. If I were to be reborn, I definitely want to be a bear.;;;;;;;;
4469;(Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai);Kodaka Hasegawa;Judging things based on looks alone... That's just cruel.;;;;;;;;
4470;(Myself ;;;;;;;;;;
4471;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Lida Ayano;The best way to write a realistic romance is to first be in love. Everyone can write a love story from their life.;;;;;;;;
4472;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Mahiro Fuwa;To you, life was just something you acted out and ended, all according to someone else's script. That's why you were always quoting Shakespeare. However, Aika, I say that you were wrong! You did what you shouldn't have, and didn't do as you should have. Because you relied on someone else's script, you were wrong. I won't live my life by another person's script. Not by Hamlet or The Tempest. I don't know how many years in the future it will be... but I'll write and act my own ending.;;;;;;;;
4473;(Psycho-Pass);Akane Tsunemori;The law doesn't protect people. People protect the law. People have always detested evil and sought out a righteous way of living. Their feelings, the accumulation of those peoples feelings are the law. They're neither the provisions, nor the system. They're the fragile and irreplaceable feelings that everyone carries in their hearts.;;;;;;;;
4474;(Fate/zero);Tohsaka Tokiomi;"From the moment a magus is born, he is someone that has ""power"". And some day, he will achieve a ""greater power"". This responsibility was already flowing in his ""blood"" before he realized this destiny. That is what it means to be born into this world as the child of a magus.";;;;;;;;
4475;(Hellsing);Montana Max;At last, the sea lion has crossed the ocean and is heading up the hill! Attention soldiers of the Millennium battalion, this is a message from your commander! Friends, let's bring them Hell.;;;;;;;;
4476;(Ouran High School Host Club);Mitsukuni Haninozuka;I like people who put in effort, even if they're not good at it. ;;;;;;;;
4477;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;Your guilt will be your past and that will be your God.;;;;;;;;
4478;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;Human memories aren't reliable. Your brain will add something or just glorify it, memories make you believe what happened was better than it actually was.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4484;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;The old me would never have known how blue the afternoon sky looks from the roof. My world is growing. What I once considered background noise is now comforting.;;;;;;;;
4485;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Kazuki Fujisawa;Sometimes, your future is already set, and there's nothing you can do about it. There are some things you just can't change, no matter how hard you work. Unfair, don't you think? It isn't an easy fact to accept, and I'm not telling you to, but that's just how life is. Unfair.;;;;;;;;
4486;(Fate/zero);Rider;Only a man brave enough to ride into battle at my side could ever be my Master. A coward lacking the courage to even show himself is nowhere close to being worthy!;;;;;;;;
4487;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Sanetoshi Watase;"In the human world, truth and reality aren't always one and the same. Humans just call their desires and ambitions as ""truth"". Humans will even kill other humans if they have ""truth"" as an excuse.";;;;;;;;
4488;(Death Note);Misa Amane;What do you mean I use my sexual charm?!;;;;;;;;
4489;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;If you leave, I'll probably be sad. However, if there's somewhere else you'd rather be, you should admit it. Don't lose sight of what you really want.;;;;;;;;
4490;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Kenji Yamaguchi;You can't feel lonely if there's no one else around.;;;;;;;;
4491;(Madlax);Laetitia;"""Falsity"" is changing the truth. ""Ignorance"" is not realizing the truth. ""Incompetence"" is being unable to fully grasp the truth.";;;;;;;;
4492;(Hellsing Ultimate);Montana Max;Then let me ask you, if your God would allow my madness to flourish across the globe, then wouldn't it seem to you that any god like that would be just as mad as I?;;;;;;;;
4493;(Shingeki no Kyojin);Grisha Jaeger;Karla, nothing can surpass a human's curiosity. ;;;;;;;;
4494;(Cowboy Bebop);Faye Valentine;The past is the past and the future is the future. A man is a man and a woman is a woman. The present is the present. I am who I am and you are who you are. That's all there is to it. Does it really matter? Or do we just think it does? ;;;;;;;;
4495;(Cowboy Bebop);Laughing Bull;Do not fear Death. Death is always at our side. When we show fear, it jumps at us faster than light. But, if we do not show fear, it casts its eye upon us gently and then guides us into infinity. ;;;;;;;;
4496;(Princess Tutu);Drosselmeyer;And so, the prince and the princess lived happily ever... Happily!? Happiness in stories is, at most, a trifling matter of a couple of lines at the end — the epitome of boredom. Now, show me a magnificent tragedy! A cataclysm of tears from which not one of the players is saved, and to which a happy ending never comes!;;;;;;;;
4497;(Cowboy Bebop);Faye Valentine;Survival of the fittest is the law of nature. We deceive or we are deceived. Thus, we flourish or perish. Nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others. That is the lesson. ;;;;;;;;
4498;(Cowboy Bebop);Jet Black;Men always seem to think about their past before they die, as though they were frantically searching for proof that they truly lived. ;;;;;;;;
4499;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;I think the only time people really have value is when they act according to their own will.;;;;;;;;
4500;(Shakugan no Shana);Shana;No matter how much everyone loves me, and no matter how much I love everyone - if I don't like it, I just can't do it.;;;;;;;;
4501;(Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha);Nanoha Takamachi;Nothing is forever. Everyone changes. They have to! Even I and so do you.;;;;;;;;
4502;(El Cazador de la Bruja);Jodie Hayward;Hearts are fragile. But hearts that support each other are as strong as steel.;;;;;;;;
4503;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yoshida Haru;I never had anything this good before. I guess everything tastes good when I'm with you.;;;;;;;;
4504;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;It's a waste of time to bother with anything uncertain.;;;;;;;;
4505;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Tea Gardner;*to Kaiba* Yugi may have lost one lousy Duel Monsters game, but at least he hasn't lost his heart! Not like you - you've spent so much time with your machines, you've forgotten what being human is about! Yugi has a heart, Kaiba. Yugi has us. And what about you, Seto Kaiba? What do you have at the end of the day? Tell me. Tell me!;;;;;;;;
4506;(Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Come Wa Machigatteiru);Yukino Yukinoshita;People who don't work hard don't have the right to be envious of the people with talent. People fail because they don't understand the hard work necessary to be successful.;;;;;;;;
4507;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Momoka Oginome;I think everything in this world is beautiful. The sky, birds, bugs, frogs, flowers, and even rocks. Because, if God created this world, could there really be anything dirty and ugly in it?;;;;;;;;
4508;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Yoshida Haru;I'm no expert, but I think people mope when their expectations are too high. It's tiring when you always have to overachieve. Don't overdo it. Just work on achieving what you can.;;;;;;;;
4509;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Shizuku Mizutani;Real friends wouldn't use you for your money. I don't have any friends, so I'm no expert, but I'd rather have no friends than have friends like them.;;;;;;;;
4510;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;There are two types of dreams. Dreams from when you're awake and dreams from when you sleep. And both of those can become reality, if you strongly wish for it.;;;;;;;;
4511;(Death Note);L Lawliet;I have two rules: First, I'm never wrong. Second, if I'm wrong... back to the first rule.;;;;;;;;
4512;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Sanetoshi Watase;None of you will ever escape the curse, as I could not. Residents of the boxes like you could never gain anything. You will all simply disappear without leaving anything behind in this world. You won't even leave a fleck of dust behind - you will never be happy!;;;;;;;;
4513;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Himari Takakura;It's no use. It's akin to love. Akin to the first kiss. It only works once.;;;;;;;;
4514;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;Everyone is alone. Everyone is empty. People no longer have need of others. You can always find a spare for any replacement. Any relationship can be replaced.;;;;;;;;
4515;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I'm afraid when something is truly lost, one can never get it back again.;;;;;;;;
4516;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Sanetoshi Watase;"What do you think of the word ""fate""? Does the concept of fate exists in reality? To put it simply, are people's futures set in stone when they are born, never to be challenged? Do you believe in such a rule? ";;;;;;;;
4517;(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo);Kazuki Fujisawa;To create something that appeals to the emotions of users, you need to make something that sways your own heart. You can't move others hearts, unless you can move your own. ;;;;;;;;
4518;(Fate/zero);Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi;(to Kiritsugu) I shall not let you die easily. I shall use healing magic to regenerate your heart and lungs, while I rend every inch of your flesh. In pain and despair, you will die as you suffer. And while you die, you will curse them... You will curse the cowardice of those who hired you! You will curse the Einzbern's for disgracing the Holy Grail War!;;;;;;;;
4519;(Fate/zero);Rider;Fail to strike the enemy once you know their location, and it'll be too late to even regret having missed the chance.;;;;;;;;
4520;(Fate/zero);Tohsaka Tokiomi;Strive to consistently maintain the proper flow. That is the Tohsaka family motto. It means always remaining reserved and elegant.;;;;;;;;
4521;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;I'm not short, I just live in a big world.;;;;;;;;
4522;(CLANNAD);Okazaki Tomoya;You should cry while you still can. When you get bigger, sometimes, you can't cry even if you have something you wanna cry about.;;;;;;;;
4523;(Fate/zero);Rider;Rarely does one have the chance to exchange blows with heroes from another age. And with the chance to fight as many as six, I can't allow one of them to fall right now. Look at Saber and Lancer. Both are valiant warriors I would love to duel with. It'd be a pity to let either die.;;;;;;;;
4524;(One Piece);Sanji;Men who can't wipe away the tears from a women's eyes, aren't real men.;;;;;;;;
4525;(Fate/zero);Lancer;Before I am a Servant, I am a knight. I can only serve but one lord.;;;;;;;;
4526;(Mobile Suit Gundam Wing);Duo Maxwell;Why did I rescue this guy in the first place? He's anti-social, thinks he's evil kenevil, and hardly speaks. You've got such a gloomy personality, why don't you stop pretending to be human.;;;;;;;;
4527;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;It's amazing how every time you open your mouth, you manage to prove you're an idiot.;;;;;;;;
4528;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;Don't judge people from the outside. Like any rose has thorns, the more the person appears nice on the outside, the more you should doubt the inside.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4531;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;In general, men prefer to let their actions speak instead of words. When they're in pain, they don't want to burden anyone with it, not if they can help it. They don't want anyone to worry about them. That's how they are. Even so, there may come a time when they'll ask for your help. And when they do, I know that you'll be there for them. Isn't that enough?;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4534;(Hayate no Gotoku!);Nagi Sanzenin;SLEEPING is the only TALENT I have.;;;;;;;;
4535;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;Books are not something that you just read words in. They're also a tool to adjust your senses.;;;;;;;;
4536;(The Big O);Roger Smith;We have choices. Some people like to stand in the rain without an umbrella. That's what it means to live free.;;;;;;;;
4537;(The Big O);Michael Seebach;I've lived my life as a newspaper reporter. I uncover the truth and write my articles. But then I learned, all too well, that a mere reporter like myself can't ever get to the truth in this city... it's nearly impossible. And it's unsure! No one here is even interested in learning the truth - a truth that must be known. But I want to know! I want to learn what must be known!;;;;;;;;
4538;(The Garden of Sinners);Aozaki Touko;"It's a rule that I've had in my life. Kill anyone who calls me ""Dirty Red"".";;;;;;;;
4539;(Fate/zero);Rider;  A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead! Saber, you said you would become a martyr for your ideals. In life, you must have been a pure saint. A proud and noble figure, certainly. But who can truly admire the martyr's thorny path? Who dreams of such an ending?;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
A king... The king must be greedier than any other. He must laugh louder and rage harder. He must exemplify the extreme of all things; good and evil. That is why his retainers envy and adore him. And why the flames of aspiration; to be as the king is; can burn within his people.   ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
Proud king of chivalry... The righteousness and ideals you bore may indeed have saved your nation once. However; I'm certain you know what became of those who were saved; but left to themselves.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
You saved them; but you never led them. You never showed them what a king should be. You abandoned your men when they lost their way. Then; alone and untroubled; you followed your own petty little ideals.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
Thus; you are no true king. You are only a little girl; enraptured by a false idol of the king who serves others;" but not themselves.""";;;;;;;;
4540;(Fate/zero);Berserker;I am the alienated, the ridiculed, the despised. No need to praise my name. No need to envy my body. I am the shadow under the radiance of heroic spirits. Birthed of the darkness of glorious legend. And so, I hate, I resent. Nourished by the sighs of the people precipitated within the darkness, people that curse the light. This is my disgrace. Because of her unsullied glory, I must forever be belittled. You are, the sacrifice. Good, give me more, your blood and flesh, your life. Let them ignite my hatred!!;;;;;;;;
4541;(Naruto);Pain;Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;
4544;(Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas);Scorpio Kardia;Life will someday extinguish. Why don't you start burning it now?;;;;;;;;
4545;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;I hate perfection. To be perfect is to be unable to improve any further.;;;;;;;;
4546;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;Strength begins in understanding your own weakness.;;;;;;;;
4547;(The Garden of Sinners);Aozaki Touko;In a business like this, there are times when you need to change as the situation demands. I switch my personality depending on how I view things.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4549;(Revolutionary Girl Utena);Akio Ohtori;You remind me so much of myself from the past. I also used to think that perseveration had some credits, that it was the best way to change the world... but with that alone you cannot accomplish anything. Without power, you're doomed to become dependent on others, that's the way the world works.;;;;;;;;
4550;(Gintama);Shimura Tae;*To Shinpachi* When your friend is crying, cry with him. When your friend is worried, you should worry with him. And when your friend has an awkward bowel movement, then you must have an awkward bowel movement too, Shin-chan. If you are a friend, you should be able to share the other's pain, no matter what. And Shin-chan, if your friend goes down the wrong path... Then, you must stop your friend, even if it ruins your friendship. That is true samurai friendship.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4552;(Psycho-Pass);Kougami Shinya;Being a detective isn't about bringing someone down, but rather protecting someone.;;;;;;;;
4553;(Zetsuen No Tempest);Hakaze Kusaribe;There are no convenient miracles, and there is logic that should be inviolable.;;;;;;;;
4554;(Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun);Natsume Asako;Who cares about school?! The real me lives on the Internet!;;;;;;;;
4555;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;Do you know how many civilizations are crowded together in the universe and how much energy is used up in one second? Eventually, you humans, will leave this planet as well, and join us. You wouldn't want to be handed an empty, desolate universe then, would you?;;;;;;;;
4556;(Mirai Nikki);Ikusaba Marco;If today is the worst day ever - tomorrow has to be better. ;;;;;;;;
4557;(Revolutionary Girl Utena);Akio Ohtori;Women who cannot become princesses have no choice but to become witches.;;;;;;;;
4558;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Setsuna F. Seiei;I wanted to know why was the world so twisted? Where did this twistedness come from? How can people be so wicked without needing to be? And why don't they realize their wickedness? Why are there things that bring chaos to so many lives? Why do people rule and let themselves be ruled? And why do they hurt each other? And why despite all that do people still want to live their lives? I was just looking for answers. I thought that if I met with you, you'd give me those answers... because you're looking for the same thing along a different path from mine - from the path where people can understand each other. ;;;;;;;;
4559;(Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu);Sakamoto Yuuji;There's one good thing about being an idiot. When they really get into something, they can simple-mindedly devote all of their attention to it. I guess some people would just call them obsessed, but to them, that's high praise!;;;;;;;;
4560;(The Garden of Sinners);Aozaki Touko;"A writer once said that ""a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when he has nothing left to add, but when he has nothing left to take away"".";;;;;;;;
4561;(Casshern Sins);Casshern;If you've forgotten death... then you've forgotten what it truly means to be alive.;;;;;;;;
4562;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Koenma;In addition to knowing the secrets of the universe, I can assure you, I am quite potty trained.;;;;;;;;
4563;(Revolutionary Girl Utena);Mamiya Chida;I wonder if the flowers themselves are happy, being forced to last so long. Eternity doesn't exist in this world, does it? It's just that one could think that a heart that longs for eternity is beautiful.;;;;;;;;
4564;(Little Busters!);Kyousuke Natsume;If the world is full of things we never wanted to know, is our only option to look away? You won't solve anything by looking away.;;;;;;;;
4565;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Charles Zi Britannia;All men are NOT created equal! Some are born smarter, or more beautiful, or with parents of greater status. Some, by contrast, are born of weak body or mind, or with few, if any, talents. All men are different! Yes, the very existence of man is discriminatory! That's why there is war, violence and unrest.;;;;;;;;
4566;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Often times, people simply deny the existence of what they do not understand, and anyone who tells them otherwise is a liar. ;;;;;;;;
4567;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Touya;"It's simple. Even the strongest tree will die if left in the dark. I find that to be the best way to describe us. A giant oak, crashing through a dark soil, bringing order to an otherwise chaotic land. The Shinobi have done their job for centuries, and done it well. But in recent years, we have caught glimpses of the outside world, and asked: ""Why not us? Have we not earned the privilege others take for free?"".";;;;;;;;

4571;(Air);Michiru;Humans can't live without memories, you know. Still, they can't live on memories alone. You have to awaken from your dreams eventually. Because dreams you don't awaken from eventually become sadness.;;;;;;;;
4572;(Special A);Tadashi Karino;Is there a different sorry for simple and complicated situations? Whether it's a simple or complicated problem, if you think you've done something wrong, then in the end you'd say sorry either way.;;;;;;;;
4573;(The Garden of Sinners);Aozaki Touko;The words “fly” and “fall” are tied together. But the more you're hooked to flying, the more you forget about that fact. As a result, you end up trying to reach the skies even after you die. Not falling to the ground, but falling toward the sky.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4575;(Casshern Sins);Casshern;Even though there is life, no one here is living it. Life is overflowing and they are merely drinking their fill. But Dio and all the people I've met on my journey aren't like that... they're.. they're more... they were blazing with fire. They were torches burning with life.;;;;;;;;
4576;(The Garden of Sinners);Fujou Kirie;It wasn't the pain that hurt me. Rather, it was the feeling of me being ripped apart, and the sound of the knife plunging deep, deep into my heart. That incomparably bittersweet fear. My body shook and trembled at the thought of it. My silent weeping contained my uneasiness, my loneliness, my will to live. My tears aren't from the pain either, or from the fear of the encounter. It was for the brush of death that I had never before experienced, but had now fallen in love with, even though I pray every night for the strength to live.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
...;;;;;;;;;;;
Please remember this. If we continue suspecting each other; continue pursuing our own self-interests... who do you think will be left standing in the ring in the end? There won't be anybody there; ladies and gentlemen. Not you;" not me... Not even the ring itself.""";;;;;;;;
4578;(Howl's Moving Castle);Sophie Hatter;A heart's a heavy burden.;;;;;;;;
4579;(Cowboy Bebop);Faye Valentine;They often say that humans can't live alone. But you can live pretty long by yourself. Instead of feeling alone in a group, it's better to be alone in your solitude.;;;;;;;;
4580;(Blood-C);Fumito Nanahara;"What do you think people are made of? I'm not talking about blood or flesh. We do care about what's on the exterior, but we want to focus more on what people even now still call the ""inside."" You can also call it ""nature"". I guess you are either born this way or raised to act this way. Are people born like this or do they become like this? The answer is...";;;;;;;;

I will show him no mercy.;;;;;;;;
4592;(Nodame Cantabile);Chiaki Shinichi;It's my own business what I decide to do and where I decide to do it.;;;;;;;;

4595;(Psycho-Pass);Shuusei Kagari;No matter where you are, people find a way to entertain themselves.;;;;;;;;
4596;(Hellsing);Alucard;You have gone and taken all those lives, and not even because you were thirsty! Is it fun... Huh! Is that what it takes for filth like you to get off..? Cheap little two bit terrors.;;;;;;;;
4597;(Psycho-Pass);Akane Tsunemori;I was the only one who got an A ranking for the Public Safety Bureau. There were more than 500 students and I was the only one. So I thought that there must have been something that only I could do at the Bureau. If I went there, I thought I could find my purpose in life... I thought I'd be able to find out why I was born here and now! ;;;;;;;;
4598;(Hyouka);Eru Chitanda;You don't have to worry about being special or normal compared to everyone else! It doesn't matter who it is. So as long as they think you're special, then you're special.;;;;;;;;
4599;(Shugo Chara);Amu Hinamori;No matter what changes, I'll still be me. And I can be whoever I want to be!;;;;;;;;
4600;(Cowboy Bebop);Jet Black;Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops. There are ends we don't desire, but they're inevitable. We have to face them. It's what being human is all about.;;;;;;;;
4601;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;Sadistic? I don't mind you calling me that. If you don't want to get hurt, don't attack me when I say not to.;;;;;;;;
4602;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;His soul was as pure as snow.;;;;;;;;
4603;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;"What would you have me say? ""Don't worry, I'm sure he's still alive.""? Ridiculous. I am not here to comfort you. I don't understand why are you so fixated on life and death? At any rate, your friends will soon be annihilated. So what if that's one step closer? They should have seen this coming from the start. If they couldn't see it coming, the fault lies in their own foolishness. Laughing them off as a group of idiots would be sufficient. Why can't you do that? If it were me, and my friends entered Hueco Mundo without first gauging their strength, I'd be infuriated by their stupidity.";;;;;;;;
4604;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;It's always like this. The only things I can ever do for Naruto are the little things anyone could do...;;;;;;;;
4605;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sakura Kyouko;Rush in there right now and break his hands and legs so he'll never be able to use them again. Make it so he won't be able to do anything without you anymore. Then he'll be yours. His heart, body, everything.;;;;;;;;

4608;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;You keep imposing your ideals on them. Don't worry about other people. You only need to do what you think is right. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4612;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;I always lied to you telling you to forgive me. I used these hands to keep you at distance... I did not want you to get involved. But now... I think you could have changed father and mother. Perhaps even the entire Uchiha. If I would have stood in front of you and looked you in the eyes from the very beginning... talked to you instead of down to you... and been open about everything. But I failed, and speaking to you now, like this, isn't going to undo the permanent damage that's already been done to you. That's why I wanted to show you the truth. Even if it's just a little. And no matter what you decide to do from here on out, you never have to forgive me - I will always love you.;;;;;;;;
4613;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;A detective who corners a culprit with their reasoning and drives them to suicide in front of himself - is no different than a murderer.;;;;;;;;

4622;(Eureka Seven);Anemone;I'm still very very young. I want to go shopping, and I want to eats lots more of all kinds of yummy foods, you know? And of course... Of course... have a wonderful romance too. If I could have something like that, it would be the best. Yeah... That really would be the best.;;;;;;;;
4623;(Ef - A Fairy Tale Of The Two);Himura Yuu;Because she learned about happiness, she feels lonely for the first time. And because she knows unhappiness, she understands happiness for the first time.;;;;;;;;
4624;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Always skillfully manipulate your pieces, that's how you survive. Use me and madam red, any piece within your reach. Even if the bodies of your pawns pile up in front of your thrown. Because if the king falls - this game is over.;;;;;;;;
4625;(Summer Wars);Sakae Jinnouchi;There's no lack of painful things in this world, but hunger and loneliness must surely be two of the worst. Thanks to you, I didn't know a moment of either of them.;;;;;;;;
4626;(Queen's Blade: Rebellion);Annelotte Kreuz;People must continue to fight for their fate. Unless they fight for the future they wish for, they will never know whether or not they can attain it.;;;;;;;;
4627;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Words are very powerful. That's why you have to watch everything that comes out from your mouth.;;;;;;;;
4628;(Spiral);Hiyono Yuizaki;They say when you fall, it's best to fall straight to the bottom, and the farther you have to crawl back up, the stronger and greater you'll be as a result.;;;;;;;;
4629;(Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni);Sonozaki Mion;Life is like a tube of toothpaste. When you've used all the toothpaste down the last squeeze, that's when you've really lived. Live with all your might. And struggle as long as you have life.;;;;;;;;
4630;(Psycho-Pass);Kougami Shinya;I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise. I wanted to go into a line of work where I could protect people. That's why I became a detective. But Makishima changed everything. That man will continue to kill people. And yet, the law can't judge him. As long as I'm a detective, I can't touch him. This case made me aware... that the law can't protect people. ;;;;;;;;
4631;(Hellsing);Alucard;It's a beautiful night. It almost makes me want to go out for a bite to drink.;;;;;;;;
4632;(The Garden of Sinners);Fujou Kirie;The flash of light I felt when I was stabbed in the heart. The overwhelming torrent of death and the beat of life. I always thought I had nothing, but there is still that simple thing left in me. This fear that sends a chill down my spine. I have to feel the most death I can to feel the happiness of life. For everything in my life I have ignored until now. But it probably would be impossible to die like I did that night. I probably cannot hope for such a striking end. That death pierced me like lightning, like a needle, like a sword. That's why I will try to come as close to that as possible. I don't have any idea right now but I still have a few days to think about it. And I've already decided on the method. I don't think I even need to say this, but I think my end should be a long fall from a place overlooking the world.;;;;;;;;
4633;(Hellsing);Alexander Anderson;Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and for thy possession, the ends of the earth. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron. Thou shalt dash them in pieces, like a potters vessel. Be wise now, therefore ye kings. Be admonished ye judges of the earth. Serve the lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, though his wrath be kindled but a little.;;;;;;;;
4634;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.;;;;;;;;
4635;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;Life isn't that sweet. That's why everyone wants sweet things.;;;;;;;;
4636;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;It's easier to crush a dream than realize one. Forming a bond is infinitely more difficult than breaking one.;;;;;;;;
4637;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;"Entire civilizations were built and destroyed between now and the last time you said ""we'll go soon""! I'll have rotted and turned to ash by the time this ""soon"" of yours comes!!";;;;;;;;
4638;(Scryed);Kanami Yuta;It's not that I hate the person in front of me. If I had met him under different circumstances, this never would have happened. But I did meet him that day, and now there is no turning back. I must distinguish the difference between past and present. Everything must be left behind, and the man in front of me is the wall;;;;;;;;

4644;(Tamako Market);Dera Mochimazzi;The year may end, but some things never do. You may not see them with your eyes, but when you look with your heart, you can.;;;;;;;;
4645;(Wolf's Rain);Kiba;I don't have anywhere to go back to. All we can do is keep moving forward.;;;;;;;;
4646;(One Piece);Crocodile;"""If I do this, I can stop the rebellion”, “if I do that, I can stop the rebellion”... Open your eyes, princess! Your zealous idealism disgusts me! Ideals can only be spoken by those powerful enough to carry them out. And that excludes you!";;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4648;(Soul Eater);Little Demon;Come with me. Overwhelming madness and power await.;;;;;;;;
4649;(Rurouni Kenshin);Seijuro Hiko;The moon peers down on a diseased world... There is no cure for the disease, an entire race walks mindlessly into destruction. Not even a man of colossal power, would be able to prevent the inevitable.;;;;;;;;

4659;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);C.C.;False tears bring pain to those around you. A false smile brings pain to one self.;;;;;;;;
4660;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;The future is not a straight line. There are many different pathways. We must try to decide that future for ourselves.;;;;;;;;
4661;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;But men are always boys at heart until the die.;;;;;;;;
4662;(Shugo Chara);Rima Mashiro;How worthless. Why are you saying things are impossible? You just decided that to make yourself feel better! Sure, there are things you can't do, things that seem impossible, but that's what makes everyone unique!;;;;;;;;
4663;(One Piece);Donquixote Doflamingo;Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!;;;;;;;;
4664;(Hunter X Hunter);Killua Zoldyck;Assassination — It's the family trade. We all take it up. My folks see me as an exceptional prospect. But I don't see that I should have to live up to their expectations.;;;;;;;;
4665;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;If a girl chases after you, it's likely a trap.;;;;;;;;
4666;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;But hating something you love is a painful feeling.;;;;;;;;
4667;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;True, I've given up on the real world. However, I haven't given up on myself.;;;;;;;;
4668;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;Well, hurting girls isn't one of my hobbies. That's why I'll make it my hobby to stomp on their cell phones. Hahahahahaha! I'm so bored of it now... it's no longer my hobby to stomp on cell phones.;;;;;;;;
4669;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Detective, don't waste your time trying to change their minds. Fight by their meaningless rules and you'll be pulled down with them. There's only one real law of the dark tournament: the strongest man prevails. I've retrieved enough energy to rip my way out, let's show this entire stadium a new definition for victory!;;;;;;;;
4670;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;Smiles and laughter are always good, but never forget your Poker Face!;;;;;;;;
4671;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Yes, Children can be quite demanding about their games.;;;;;;;;
4672;(Kino No Tabi);Kino;It's probably a lie. The reason why I only stay for three days in any country. I'm afraid I'll settle down, if I stay too long. Because if I settled down, I would cease to be a traveler.;;;;;;;;
4673;(Hunter X Hunter);Kurapika;I do not fear death. I fear only that my rage will fade over time.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4676;(Detective Conan);Kaitou Kid;You are right. I am not a detective, but a thief. And stealing is what thieves do best, even if it's a persons heart. ;;;;;;;;
4677;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Unfortunately, in reality there is no situation where one can win merely by following the rules. There will be knights that break the rules, and even chess pieces that betray him.;;;;;;;;
4678;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;Justice is not something that you can express in words.;;;;;;;;
4679;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;A man who raises his hands on a woman is trash. If I have to become trash in order to survive... It'll be just like dying.;;;;;;;;

4683;(07 Ghost);Frau;If you're going to hide a tree, put it in the forest.;;;;;;;;
4684;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;I guess it's only natural for inferior beings to ride on the coattails of their superior counterparts. If they wish to keep their lives, they have no choice but to obediently comply. It's a never ending chain... as the ones who are burdened with that trust, in order to escape that burden, seek to find someone even greater than themselves. These greater beings then seek others even greater than themselves to shelter them. This is how Gods are born. But make no mistake. They all still abide to me. Because from this point onward, you will witness first hand, the power of the God they foolishly placed their faith in. I will become that God they have no choice but to believe in.;;;;;;;;
4685;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Mysterious things are everywhere. So bizarre as often as you can hear of them. Without witness, with sight unseen, without a care it is simply a phenomenon. Merely not of concern. In this world, mankind itself has its own fantastic wonders.;;;;;;;;
4686;(07 Ghost);Frau;We aren't flying away from everyone to leave them, but rather so we might see them again someday.;;;;;;;;
4687;(Blood-C);Fumito Nanahara;It's difficult to change someone's emotions, no matter how they are, so long as they are deeply engraved in the heart. I suppose hatred would be the hardest. Many people will say that hatred fades over time, but that doesn't mean it ever really goes away. It's still there. It's just hiding where you can't see it, and given the slightest chance, it will reassert itself. Now then, given hatred's persistence, what should you do if you can't get rid of it? The only possibility is to overwrite it with an equally powerful emotion – with an emotion as strong as hatred… Yes, those would be love and trust.;;;;;;;;
4688;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;I've been looking out at the world through windows I've opened across the net. It's an extremely close-minded and twisted world.;;;;;;;;

4700;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Pain tends to heal as time passes, but personally, I don't want time to heal my wounds. You may think you've escaped the pain and forgotten it, but that's nothing more than stagnation. You can't move forward without the pain.;;;;;;;;

4713;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Say, how about we put an end to all of this? The two of us could become Witches and destroy everything!

Isn't that nice?;;;;;;;;

4715;(Psycho-Pass);Makishima Shougo;You can play any character and yet in the end, you yourself are nobody. Your core personality is null. It's empty. That's how you could wear any mask all over your smooth, featureless face and have it fit perfectly.;;;;;;;;

4719;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;Water is the greatest enemy of games.;;;;;;;;
4720;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;"In the first place, the logic that says ""those who play games are kids"" is itself an allusion, therefore one might say that shoehorning reality into your stubborn dualism is already a criticism of the self. In short, humans can only recognize reality through the filter called ""me"" and so they are unable to escape the constraints of their uncanny existence.";;;;;;;;

4749;(Mobile Suit Gundam 00);Lockon Stratos;The only thing you can change about the past is how you feel about it in the present.;;;;;;;;
4750;(Blood-C);Fumito Nanahara;When a person encounters that which they cannot understand, what do they do? Why, they think. But you know, the more you think about something, the further you get from the truth. Yes. Your thoughts get in the way of what your instincts desire. In the way of the real answer.;;;;;;;;
4751;(Tasogare Otome X Amnesia);Kanoe Yuuko;People don't realize they aren't able to choose whether or not to believe something. If they subconsciously believe something, therein lies the potential for a curse.;;;;;;;;
4752;(Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai!);Togashi Yuuta;I am the Dark Flame Master. Perish, enveloped in the flames of darkness!;;;;;;;;
4753;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Makoto Niwa;To have a name. To remove one layer of the unknown. To be painted in reality. If you have your feet firmly planted to the ground, you may have a chance to pull someone down.  ;;;;;;;;
4754;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Yashiro Hoshimiya;If you don't trust the boy who cries wolf - in other words, a child who lies, your sheep and goats will all get eaten. But who gives a damn about moral lectures. The important part is that because the boy believed in his lies, he really brought a wolf to the village. You can't deny that! *to Niwa Makoto*;;;;;;;;
4755;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Maekawa;For questions where your chance of being correct is 50/50, it's best to go with your gut response.;;;;;;;;
4756;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;True detective work is beyond the general masses. After all, we're advocates for the dead. We dig up what was lost to the grave and hurt the living to defend the honor of the dead. And we humiliate the dead to comfort the living.;;;;;;;;
4757;(Kokoro Connect);Himeko Inaba;There won't be any pain if you don't do anything stupid.;;;;;;;;
4758;(Yami no Matsuei);Kazutaka Muraki;Humans are weak. For every cure found, another disease is uncovered. It's a game of chase.;;;;;;;;

4764;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;People can wish for anything. Happiness or unhappiness. No matter what kind of choice you made, it was the result you chose... As long as you're not regretting the result, it is all right.;;;;;;;;
4765;(Naruto);Pain;We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge that we deem to be justice. But... if there is justice in revenge then that same justice will breed only more revenge... and trigger a cycle of hatred.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4767;(Naruto);Pain;How can you say that you will never change? That you will not change, no matter how great the pain you face? Can you continue believing in yourself forever? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith in yourself?!;;;;;;;;

4772;(Bleach);Kojima Mizuiro;My smile is nothing more than a pose, I can give it to anyone, anytime, anywhere...;;;;;;;;
4773;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;A sword is a weapon. The art of swordsmanship is learning how to kill. What Miss Kaoru says is nothing but sweet and innocent talk, only those whose hands have never been stained with the blood of man can believe.;;;;;;;;
4774;(Rurouni Kenshin);Hajime Saitou;I would think that he's already seen through your heart, and is simply playing the fool to use you. He yanks on the strings of your cheap pride and you dance like a little marionette.;;;;;;;;
4775;(Dance in the Vampire Bund);Mina Tepeş;In this world, filled with violence, blood and scheming, the promise we made on that day was my one and only refuge.;;;;;;;;
4776;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Different conclusions are reached when one fact is viewed from two separate points of view. When that happens, there is no immediate way to judge which point of view is the correct one. There is no way to conclude one's own conclusion is the correct one. But for that exact reason, it is also premature to decide one's own conclusion is wrong. ;;;;;;;;
4777;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Mifune Ryouko;I find it fascinating how we can see something with our eyes, hear with our ears and speak from our mouths. Although science tells us how they work, I just really can't grasp it. I don't know how everyday items like phones work. I can't even explain why a bicycle is fast. When I think like this, I wonder how many things I really understand. Yet I can live on. Because all these mysteries have joined together to keep me alive. Sometimes I admire that before I go to bed.;;;;;;;;
4778;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;You will not touch these innocent people with even one inch of your dirty blades, if you require an opponent, I will fight you. If you wanna taste the ground, feel free to attack me.;;;;;;;;

4785;(Naruto);Rock Lee;My motto is to be stronger than yesterday, if I have to I'll be stronger than half a day ago, even a minute ago!;;;;;;;;
4786;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;Battles aren't supposed to be heroic affairs. They are not supposed to be fun or exciting, to us every battle is filled with despair, they are dark, horrifying, grizzly. We should fear warfare, avoid it always and whenever possible choose the path of peace.;;;;;;;;
4787;(Bleach);Starrk;How I envy the feeble and frail... If I were inept, I could simply blend in, not stand out, and get lost in the crowd. I yearned to be just another sheep... And if that was asking too much I'd settle for... walking among the lions.;;;;;;;;
4788;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;There are only two professions in the whole world that give meaning to those who have died and what have been lost... They're writers and detectives. Writers are the only ones able to revive what was lost through their visions. Detectives are the only ones able to dig up the grave and bring back lost information. But the information us detectives dig up is nothing more than the truth as recorded in Heaven's Memo Pad.;;;;;;;;
4789;(Chihayafuru);Tsutomu Komano;When you find yourself wishing that a certain person was also here, that person is like family to you. Regardless of how long or how well you know them.;;;;;;;;
4790;(Kamisama No Memochou);Narumi Fujishima;The crowd of people looks just like pixels in a picture to me. A single pixel is meaningless. But add two, three and four... They pile up rapidly until they ultimately form a picture. But I've never seen that picture.;;;;;;;;
4791;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;NEETs aren't people who can't do or won't do things. The only difference is the rules. Because we're playing with different rules, we're forced to do things differently. The participants are disoriented. They frown. Then they are discouraged by labeling and stereotyping and find comfort in isolation.;;;;;;;;
4792;(Guilty Crown);Gai Tsutsugami;There are only two paths you can choose. You can sit quietly and be selected out of this world, or you can adapt and change.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4794;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;A detective must become nothing more than an advocate. We must never put words to the feelings that failed to take form.;;;;;;;;
4795;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;The world... is a very small place, but... for those who know it, it is very, very large. And the world... when it is viewed by those who know... is far larger than just one world can hold.;;;;;;;;

4797;(Nabari no Ou);Shijima Kurookano;Everyone is sacrificing something precious to them in order to save something else. Is that the reason for human action? ;;;;;;;;
4798;(Rurouni Kenshin);Makoto Shishio;In this world, the weak are the sustenance of the strong. The strong live, the weak die.;;;;;;;;
4799;(07 Ghost);Mikage;Revenge never does anyone any good. Killing the person you hate will never ease the pain. Always look forward! Follow the path of light!;;;;;;;;
4800;(Nabari no Ou);Kazuhiko Yukimi;There are three kinds of secrets. Something that you hide at the bottom of your heart because you don't want it to be mentioned. Something that you can't say even if you want to and something that you hope someone asks about even though you're hiding it. ;;;;;;;;
4801;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;This is the world you've stuck yourself into, if you aren't strong enough to lead, then you lose the privilege of getting what you want.;;;;;;;;
4802;(Kamisama No Memochou);Shionji Yuuko;Human emotions are ambiguous. A person can have contradicting feelings. I know how they are capable of creating lies and pain when reflected in the real world. That's why we have words. Words are brutally precise. They give form to feelings while mercilessly killing anything left unsaid.;;;;;;;;
4803;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;New eras don't come about because of swords, they're created by the people who wield them.;;;;;;;;

4809;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;Once the revenge is dealt, you are required to pay the compensation.;;;;;;;;
4810;(Medaka Box);Myouri Unzen;Rule breakers should be punished. If you go easy on them, they'll think explaining their circumstances will get them forgiven, and the same thing will only happen again.;;;;;;;;
4811;(Sword Art Online);Kazuto Kirigaya;I'd rather trust and regret, than doubt and regret.;;;;;;;;
4812;(Medaka Box);Myouri Unzen;It's not justice if you don't go overboard.;;;;;;;;
4813;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;While you're alive, you need a reason for your existence. Being unable to find one is the same as being dead.;;;;;;;;
4814;(Hunter X Hunter);Kurapika;The only principle is that there is no principles. ;;;;;;;;
4815;(Outlaw Star);Hilda;No one's going to give you a map. You've got to walk your own path. ;;;;;;;;
4816;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;Your sudden smiles always surprise me. But are dangerous enough to make my heart race.;;;;;;;;
4817;(Kaiji);Yukio Tonegawa;"Normally, those people would never wake up from their fantasy worlds. They live meaningless lives. They waste their precious days over nothing. No matter how old they get, they'll continue to say, ""My real life hasn't started yet. The real me is still asleep, so that's why my life is such garbage."" They continue to tell themselves that. And they age. Then die. And on their deathbeds, they will finally realize: the life they lived was the real thing. People don't live provisional lives, nor do they die provisional deaths. That's a simple fact! The problem... is whether they realize that simple fact.";;;;;;;;
4818;(Medaka Box);Myouri Unzen;Justice and charity don't mix.;;;;;;;;

4821;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Death and pain are just a small price to pay for the enjoyment of battle!;;;;;;;;
4822;(Love Hina);Noriyasu Seta;Excavating won't always get you what you want. Maybe after digging, nothing will come out at all. That's why I love it. Because if we don't try, we would never find anything. ;;;;;;;;
4823;(Toaru Majutsu no Index);Mikoto Misaka;If one side is putting all their efforts into killing a normal high school student and the other side is putting all their efforts into saving that normal high school student, which side do you want to be on?

4827;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;You and I, our levels are as distant as the earth from the heavens. Must I spell it out for you? I have discarded my left arm, discarded my left leg, and yet even then I have not nearly lowered myself to your level.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
4829;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;For everything you wish, you have to pay an equal price in return. You can't get more or give more. You can't get less or give less. It must be in balance, or else there will be chaos.;;;;;;;;
4830;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;No matter how unimportant the meeting... how small the outcome... it will always have some later effect on you. It can be the smallest of things. It can be the shortest of moments. It may never be remembered. It may have never been recorded. But a bond of fate never disappears once tied.;;;;;;;;
4831;(Kino);Hermes;The world is constantly changing. And you can't expect it to stay the same, even for a second. If that's true, there's no need for you to go on a journey, Kino. Even if you stay in one place, you'll be able to keep experiencing the world.;;;;;;;;
4832;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Look at this world, so many people deserve to be killed. At the same time, a murderer must be ready to be killed as he lives. That's what retribution is. So, in this world, evil or whatever, a person strongly determined to live is the one who survives in the end.;;;;;;;;

Everyone lives their lives to the fullest in a world where things change with the passage of time. But I'm sure some things won't ever change.

For we can accelerate.;;;;;;;;
4838;(xxxHOLiC);Yuuko Ichihara;Sincerity with respect to yourself! No matter what your objective... no matter who you are... if you are going to do something or not do something, that is a promise to yourself. And the one who keeps the promise, or breaks the promise, is you. No one else can be burdened with holding you to a promise that's made to yourself. ;;;;;;;;
4839;(Xenogears);Elhaym Van Houten;"It's okay not to feel ""whole"". Even if you feel only partly complete, if you repeat that enough, it'll eventually be ""whole"". A part... is better than zero.";;;;;;;;

4852;(Nisemonogatari);Mayoi Hachikuji;In a way, the supernatural is what's behind the curtain. Normally, you only need to see what's happening on stage. That's how reality works.

4854;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;People who kill too much, turn into dragons one day. Beasts that rule the land atop piles of money and fly the skies with authority. They become more and more violent, until they can no longer understand the language of men. We cannot allow dragons to remain in this world, even though we are the ones from which they are spawned.

4858;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;The first requirement of being a hero isn't being right. It's being strong. That's why the hero always wins.;;;;;;;;
4859;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;Weapons are used by soldiers on the battlefield. If you have never used them yourself, you have no idea what you're selling.;;;;;;;;
4860;(Nisemonogatari);Mayoi Hachikuji;Sharing your secret with someone means you involve them in your problems. It may make things easier for you, but your family could end up suffering for it too.;;;;;;;;

4871;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sayaka Miki;It really shouldn't be all that uncommon - having a wish you'd go so far as to trade your life for. I think there are a lot of people in the world with wishes and desires like that. If we can't think of anything, it just means that we really haven't had anything that bad happen to us. We've had too much given to us and have become dull and stupid. It makes me wonder: Why us?;;;;;;;;

"Don't you think it's unfair? I'm sure there are other people who'd really want a chance like this.""";;;;;;;;;;;
4872;(Bakemonogatari);Deishū Kaiki;Oh, right, Senjougahara. I've got a great story to tell you. It's about that man who tried to rape you way back.

So I turned to my dad and asked him,""Do you know how many people are here right now""? He said probably fifty thousand, since the stadium was full. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan.

4942;(FLCL);Naota Nandaba;Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary. The huge factory that can be seen from our town, the Medical Mechanica Plant, all the adults got excited when it came here, like it was really a big thing.

We are so strong with all of our men and our guns!"" *laughs*";;;;;;;;
4951;(Baccano!);Graham Specter;Tedium is such a crime. It takes the limited amount of time that is given to man, and rather than spending it in indolence or drowning it in pleasure it just sits there sucking, eating it up. I can't put up with that, tedium is a crime! Death to tedium! Die!;;;;;;;;

5051;(Fate/zero);Mackenzie Glen;When you look back after a long life, you'll realize there's nothing that's really worth risking your life for.;;;;;;;;
5052;(Zetman);Inspector Sayama;It's when things are tough that you have to keep your head up high. You won't find hope lying on the ground.;;;;;;;;
5053;(Sakamichi no Apollon);Tokie;You can't just wait. You need to make things happen yourself.;;;;;;;;
5054;(Kyoukai Senjou No Horizon);Aoi Toori;I may be inept, but at least I don't forget to aim high!;;;;;;;;
5055;(Fate/zero);Kaminski Natalia;If you act only on what you should do without heed for what you want to do, you're nothing more than a machine, a phenomenon.;;;;;;;;
5056;(Ouran High School Host Club);Hikaru Hitachiin;Our mom put us in one of those *points to dresses* when we were little. We still get called 'her darling little girls' at our family reunions.;;;;;;;;
5057;(Ouran High School Host Club);Takashi Morinozuka;*To Haruhi, when at her home*  You like strawberries, right? Here, you can have mine.;;;;;;;;
5058;(Kyoukai Senjou No Horizon);Futayo Honda;Loyalty is only given meaning through one's actions.;;;;;;;;
5059;(Fate/zero);Waver Velvet;I'm scared. Or should I borrow your words and say this is exciting?;;;;;;;;
5060;(Fate/stay night);Archer;The wish of wanting everyone to be happy is merely a fairy tale!;;;;;;;;
5061;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;A path not chosen is the same as a path that never existed.;;;;;;;;
5062;(Fate/zero);Gilgamesh;Ephemeral and brilliant one, fall to my embrace. That is my decision.;;;;;;;;
5063;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;People like you walk your paths, believing that something you desire is waiting for you. I walk it to confirm that there is nothing there.;;;;;;;;
5064;(Ouran High School Host Club);Hikaru Hitachiin;*To Kaoru* Even if I searched the world over, no one could compare to you.;;;;;;;;
5065;(Ouran High School Host Club);Takashi Morinozuka;It was my fault. It was my carelessness that led to Mitsukuni's cavity. I forgot to tell him to brush his teeth before napping... twice.;;;;;;;;
5066;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;*To Pantherlily* We'll stop it, even if my body crumbles to bits, I'll stop it with my soul!;;;;;;;;
5067;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;I think it's fun to get to know a person little by little, through looking at their personality.;;;;;;;;
5068;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Then let me ask you, do gods of death love apples?;;;;;;;;
5069;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;Besides, it doesn't really matter, does it? Why should I care about appearances and labels anyway. It's what's on the inside that counts.;;;;;;;;
5070;(Ouran High School Host Club);Mitsukuni Haninozuka;*To the twins* We've had enough of this! You're both to blame for this fight! Hika-chan and Kao-chan, I want you to make up and go halfsies on this cake, okay? But, I want to have a piece too, so I guess we're gonna have to go thirdsies. We're not going to be able to split the strawberry on top though. What should we do? Maybe I should just take it. After all, strawberries are my favorite. Oh, I forgot to ask, Hika-chan, Kao-chan, do you like strawberries?;;;;;;;;
5071;(Paradise Kiss);Koizumi George;I'll make you so in love with me, that every time our lips touch you'll die a little.;;;;;;;;
5072;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Kiritsugu;The result is the most important thing.;;;;;;;;
5073;(Naruto);Orochimaru;There probably isn't any meaning in life. Perhaps you can find something interesting to do while you are alive. Like how you found that flower. Like how I found you.;;;;;;;;
5074;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;My face feels heavy, and I can't walk in these shoes.;;;;;;;;
5075;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Kiritsugu;If I can, I'd prefer nobody to be sad.;;;;;;;;
5076;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;"*To Kuchiki Rukia* Are you any different!? You sacrificed yourself to save me that time!! At that time were you thinking about complicated stuff like ""this is my Shinigami duty""!? That's not what sacrificing yourself is! At the very least... I'm different! I haven't accepted any commitment. If things get bad I might run away... since I'm not a good enough person to be able to sacrifice my life for total strangers. But unfortunately I'm also not trash that can live happily without paying back his debts!";;;;;;;;
5077;(Fate/stay night);Archer;An ideal is only an ideal after all. As long as you embrace that ideal, the friction with reality will continue to increase. So you will someday face reality and will have to pay the price for your compromises.;;;;;;;;
5078;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;I hate all these damn rich people.;;;;;;;;
5079;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Kiritsugu;I was reckless when I was young. I educated myself by cursing the heartlessness of the world. The world was cruel - so I made myself more heartless and used that as a weapon, trying to follow through on my ideals.;;;;;;;;
5080;(Ouran High School Host Club);Mitsukuni Haninozuka;I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Takashi! I won't forget to brush my teeth again! I won't forget!...;;;;;;;;
5081;(Ouran High School Host Club);Haruhi Fujioka;Mom... Mom in heaven.... Does love come suddenly like this;;;;;;;;
5082;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Know that the only people you can save like that are the ones that survive.;;;;;;;;
5083;(Prince Of Tennis);Fuji Shuusuke;Even if we are far apart. We'll always be united by tennis.;;;;;;;;
5084;(Prince Of Tennis);Fuji Shuusuke;It's still too early for you to win against me.;;;;;;;;
5085;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Hinata... this is the unalterable difference in strength... the distinction that separates the elite from the failure. This is the unchangeable reality. From the moment you said you wouldn't run, your defeat was inevitable. The only possible outcome was your present despair... Withdraw!;;;;;;;;
5086;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;I'm gonna kick your ***.;;;;;;;;
5087;(Naruto);Orochimaru;"[To Sarutobi] What nonsense! In the grand scheme of time, you're nothing more than a trivial footnote in the brief history of a cluster of huts called the ""Leaf Village""! In time, the Hokage Stone Faces will crumble and be worn down to nothing...";;;;;;;;
5088;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;[To Hinata At Chuunin Exams] So you're not going to withdraw? Then don't blame me for what happens to you.;;;;;;;;
5089;(Howl's Moving Castle);Sophie Hatter;They say that the best blaze burns brightest, when circumstances are at their worst.;;;;;;;;
5090;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;People like you... are the reason why people like me need medication.;;;;;;;;
5091;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Oh sorry, my hand slipped.;;;;;;;;
5092;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;I think running a restaurant would fit you better than being an assassin.;;;;;;;;
5093;(Naruto);Haku;{TO NARUTO} Oh, by the way... I'm a boy;;;;;;;;
5094;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;You're a hero to other poor people, Fujioka. You've shown the world that even a poor person can excel at an elite private academy. It must be hard for you to constantly be looked down upon by others... Spurned, neglected, but that doesn't matter now. Long live the poor! We welcome you, poor man, to our world... of beauty!;;;;;;;;
5095;(Naruto);Haku;Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing... that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don't you see? It's an empty existence, to go on living... alone and unloved... when defeat's already cost you your dream!;;;;;;;;
5096;(Lucky Star);Kagami Hiiragi;Could you stop skipping the thinking process when you respond?;;;;;;;;
5097;(Ouran High School Host Club);Suoh Tamaki;*To Haruhi Fujioka about him helping her search for her wallet in water* A little water never hurt anyone. Besides, people are always telling me that I'm dripping with good looks.;;;;;;;;
5098;(Naruto);Gaara;Bitter crimson tears flow from lifeless eyes, and mingle with the endless sands... Bestowing ever greater power upon the demon god.;;;;;;;;
5099;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;I put a propulsion engine under your seat just in case you messed up.;;;;;;;;
5100;(Lucky Star);Konata Izumi;And the TV show ended by saying how young people are becoming increasingly illiterate, but doesn't browsing the Internet and blogging actually improve your literacy?;;;;;;;;
5101;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Hakua Du Lot Herminium;Don't make it sound so easy! Don't you realize how hard I had to study? I worked hard... I worked so hard!;;;;;;;;
5102;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;Bye-Bye now.;;;;;;;;
5103;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Their mistakes were simple ones. Gouki's mistake was being overconfident and Kurama's... sympathy for his human prey.;;;;;;;;
5104;(Lucky Star);Konata Izumi;Sounds like a lot of work, I think I'll pass. I'd rather play and I'll ask for help when I get stuck.;;;;;;;;
5105;(Cowboy Bebop);Spike Spiegel;I love the type of woman who can kick my ***.;;;;;;;;
5106;(Black Lagoon);Revy;All they saw in me was another little ghetto rat with no power and no God. What's left for a poor little Chinese bitch to rely on? It's money of course. And guns. Fuckin' A, with these two things, the world is a great place.;;;;;;;;
5107;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;Finally I saw... A world so bright I almost wanted to cry... It was then, that my consciousness was engulfed in darkness.;;;;;;;;
5108;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;In my mind this jacked-up sideways ridiculousness is the normal state?;;;;;;;;
5109;(Baccano!);Ladd Russo;Depending on your request, whether I will laugh or get angry - that will decide your lifespan, boy.;;;;;;;;
5110;(Baccano!);Graham Specter;Incomprehensibility is a part of human life. But what does this mean? I just can't understand it.;;;;;;;;
5111;(Avatar: The Legend Of Korra);Aang;When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.;;;;;;;;
5112;(Avatar: The Legend Of Korra);Amon;I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that. It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. ALMOST.;;;;;;;;
5113;(Avatar: The Legend Of Korra);Mako;We didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it. You're the most loyal, brave and selfless person I've ever known.;;;;;;;;
5114;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;All people have sanctuary which mustn't be touched. A scar of sadness which mustn't be entered. The living confront each other to achieve their ideals. In a quiet voice, the man in the white coat told me... that he had finally found me, that he wanted my life. That man smiled a smile deeper than darkness. Legato Bluesummers, a man fascinated by Death...;;;;;;;;
5115;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;Between being eternally unable to wake from a dream, and being eternally unable to dream, which do you think would be more unfortunate? Still, both the dream that we deemed eternal, and this very reality, are destined to end someday.;;;;;;;;
5116;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;I think it's good if someone smiles when you smile at them. The beauty of voluntary acts can foster goodwill in the hearts of others. Love which doesn't ask for collateral gives us respect as people. However it's wrong to sustain that. In time, the strain will bloom into the flower called Lie...the thorny flower which hurts people.;;;;;;;;
5117;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;Can a world this interesting actually be reality?;;;;;;;;
5118;(Baccano!);Claire Stanfield;So what if I'd spare him? In my mind it's the certainty in myself that I possess which allows me to have that kind of mercy or compassion. There's no wavering on that point. It's fixed like the stars. The fact is I'm never gonna be killed! So remember this: mercy and compassion are virtues that only the strong are privileged to possess. And I am strong.;;;;;;;;
5119;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;The power of one man doesn't amount to much. But, however little strength I'm capable of, I'll do everything humanly possible to protect the people I love, and in turn they will protect the ones they love. It seems like the least we tiny humans can do for each other.;;;;;;;;
5120;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;There's no need to change the past. Because of the past we are who we are now. Every second, every action from then is linked to us here and now.;;;;;;;;
5121;(Fate/zero);Irisviel von Einzbern;I have no parents, and I'm not a product of love. Therefore, I can't understand what a 'good wife' is. Even so... the love he gave me is my entire world. No one can humiliate that.;;;;;;;;
5122;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;Why is it that when humans regret the decision based on a misunderstanding they feel resentment toward the other party?;;;;;;;;
5123;(Soul Eater);Little Demon;"You are calm and composed. You are able to see through things clearly at this age. You are outstanding. And... Always being able to make the correct judgments, not falling into darkness. Outstanding. ""That won't do"", ""This is wrong"". You reject any number of paths... Choosing your path with cynicism. What do you want to do? How are you going to do it? What is your motive? Where do you want to move forward to? Say it. Hmm? Fine. Then stick to the ground forever to move forward, you creep. You little coward who can only move forward by using the method of elimination. Until you found something to reject... You shall just lie on the ground helplessly.";;;;;;;;
5124;(Baccano!);Claire Stanfield;I won't die no matter what. That's what I believe, so stay silent and believe in me. I am a guy who will never die.;;;;;;;;
5125;(Baccano!);Graham Specter;Oh, life is fun! Try sayin' that ten times fast ten thousand times a minute every day for the rest of your life and it'll screw with your head so bad that all problems will disappear like MAGIC! Okay okay okay, I've gotten past the sadness and as of now I'm evolving to a HIGHER STAAAATE! Right? Tell me you all think so! Life is a magnificent beast, and it excites me!;;;;;;;;
5126;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;I can see the ending!;;;;;;;;
5127;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;Our lives were real! Not a single moment of them were fake! Everyone lived the best they could! We carved those memories into ourselves! Memories of living as hard as we could! No matter what kind they were, they're the life we led! Erasing them in the blink of an eye like that... Wasn't your life also real to you?!;;;;;;;;
5128;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;There is always a chance of success, and if there isn't any, I'll just have to make one.;;;;;;;;
5129;(Fate/zero);Emiya Kiritsugu;I don't think it's possible to save everyone. I just want to save as many as I can.;;;;;;;;
5130;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;I only have one chance to have my life, and it's right here. It's the only life I have. This is my life. I can't give it to anyone else, It can't be stolen, I can't force it on anyone, or forget it, or make it disappear, or trample on it, or laugh it away, or beautify it. I have no choice but to accept this one cruel, meaningless life! That's why I will fight, and why I will continue fighting.;;;;;;;;
5131;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Celebrating Mr. Jesus's birthday (Christmas) was fun, why don't we celebrate Buddha's and Muhammad's birthday next time?;;;;;;;;
5132;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;That's why people hesitate. In front of all the choices, one could lose hope and try to run away, because no excuse could be used. No matter how dangerous the long journey in life was, or how one admits to being dealt the short end of the stick, everything was the result of one's own choices, it was a road chosen by oneself. Even if this path is hard, and there's no chance of changing past choices, one cannot place the blame on other people. No matter how angry or frustrated one was, one would be alone on that path, for no one to replace you.;;;;;;;;
5133;(Baccano!);Claire Stanfield;This world is mine. I think this world may even just be a long, long dream I'm watching. You guys may just be illusions, and it can't be proven whether or not you really exist either. In other words, this world was created with me at the center. So what will happen if I die? I don't know. My imagination isn't very creative;;;;;;;;
5134;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;I dreamed that you were a dog. And the dog was my husband. Anyway, it was the worst dream ever.;;;;;;;;
5135;(CLANNAD);Fujibayashi Kyou;If the results come true, it's as if there's only one future. If it fails, we can think that other futures exist... I want to believe that in our future there are many possibilities waiting.;;;;;;;;
5136;(Jormungand);Koko Hekmatyar;You get free hatred for everything you sell. I've amassed a real supply of it, so I'd like to sell it too... But no one wants to buy it from me!;;;;;;;;
5137;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;Don't be upset because of what you can't do. Do what you do best, live as carefree and optimistically as you can, because some people aren't able to do that.;;;;;;;;
5138;(Toradora!);Taiga Aisaka;Well, I'd better get back to my seat. The unmarried woman with her unmarried face is about to come to start the unmarried homeroom.;;;;;;;;
5139;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;Even if we forget the faces of our friends, We will never forget the bonds that were carved into our souls.;;;;;;;;
5140;(Fate/zero);Saber;I only joined this war to avoid spilling rivers of blood. Fight for the Holy Grail, no meaningless bloodshed, minimize sacrifices, one person taking up the mission of fate instead of armies of men and competing here! This is what we Servants should do.;;;;;;;;
5141;(Fate/stay night);Kotomine Kirei;You should know. Your wish will not come true unless there is a clear evil. Even if it's not something you approve of, a hero of justice requires a villain to defeat.;;;;;;;;
5142;(Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai);Keima Katsuragi;Reality is just a crappy game!;;;;;;;;
5143;(Fate/stay night);Saber;Anything edible is acceptable. Extravagance is our enemy.;;;;;;;;
5144;(Accel World);Haruyuki Arita;Strength isn't just about winning. Even if my attempts are pathetic and comical, and even if I'm covered in the mud of my defeat, if I can keep fighting and look up at the sky as I lie on the ground, that alone is proof of true strength!;;;;;;;;
5145;(Fate/zero);Emiya Kiritsugu;The world as it is, the human nature as always, it is impossible to eliminate battles. In the end, killing is necessarily evil. If so, it is best to end them in the maximum efficiency and at the least cost, least time. If you want to slander that as foul and demean that as nasty, then do as you wish. Justice can not save the world. I have no interest with things like that.;;;;;;;;
5146;(Kuroko No Basket);Tetsuya Kuroko;No one knows what the right decision, to make in life, is, and that is not why I made this choice.;;;;;;;;
5147;(Fate/zero);Emiya Kiritsugu;In the battlefield, there is no place for hope. What lies there is only cold despair and a sin called victory, built on the pain of the defeated. All those people who met there have wholeheartedly admitted the evil and foolishness of this act called war. As long as people don't repent and don't regard it as the most evil taboo, then hell will endlessly reappear in the world.;;;;;;;;
5148;(Fate/zero);Kotomine Kirei;Conflict is humanity's primal instinct. Eliminating it would mean eliminating humanity itself.;;;;;;;;
5149;(Fate/zero);Emiya Kiritsugu;Justice cannot save the world. It is useless.;;;;;;;;
5150;(Fate/zero);Rider;Up until now, have you not faced the same enemies as I? That means you are my friend! So hold your chest high, and consider yourself my equal.;;;;;;;;
5151;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;If you truly want to continue escaping from everyday life, you've no other choice but to keep evolving. No matter whether you're aiming higher or lower.;;;;;;;;
5152;(Durarara!!);Erika Karisawa;If you make fiction just as valuable as reality, then any reality you don't need can be a delusion.;;;;;;;;
5153;(Durarara!!);Shizuo Heiwajima;I don't have have much time. It's not that I'm busy, but I'm only willing to give you about two and a half more minutes of my life!;;;;;;;;
5154;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;I don't believe in god. There's no proof he exists. In a world where there isn't even proof of the future, the past exists. Even if it's tainted with misunderstandings and delusions, if the people themselves believe in it, the past is the truth to them. And, if you base your actions or your life around it, in a way, it's a type of god itself.;;;;;;;;
5155;(Durarara!!);Ryuugamine Mikado;I don't have the strength or wisdom to stand up against someone who is insusceptible to reason. You won't even give me time to make an effort. That's why I'm going to rely on numbers!;;;;;;;;
5156;(Durarara!!);Erika Karisawa;Reality is such a pain. And for those of us who get fed up with that kind of reality, we simply choose to make a new one. We create little walls, and separate the trash from the stuff we like, and when that's all done we keep the things we care about and kick the rest to the curb. You'd be amazed how well it works! A whole world made out of just moe, tsundere, and BL, it's the best discovery ever! If you ask me, that really is the best way to separate reality, from fiction.;;;;;;;;
5157;(Durarara!!);Izaya Orihara;Well, hurting girls isn't one of my hobbies. That's why I'll make it my hobby... to stomp on their cell phones. Hahahahahaha!;;;;;;;;
5158;(Blood+);Saya Otonashi;Our hearts beat in the same rhythm, so why does time flow differently for the two of us?;;;;;;;;
5159;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;I've always been asking myself this question. Am I a memory? or is the memory... ME? Are we nothing but a collection of memories?;;;;;;;;
5160;(No.6);Sion;If I hadn't met you, I never would have realized what kind of person I am. I would have grown into an apathetic, clueless, obedient adult. However, after spending time with you, in tears, laughter, and anger, I now know that I have all these emotions inside me, too. And that makes me proud. I'm glad to have known you.;;;;;;;;
5161;(Hyouka);Eru Chitanda;I find myself hard to understand sometimes.;;;;;;;;
5162;(Jormungand);Kasper Hekmatyar;Now you know what fear does to you. In the face of death you thought.;;;;;;;;
5163;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Madoka. My only friend... If... If it's for your sake... I don't mind being locked in this eternal maze!;;;;;;;;
5164;();Tsuchimiya Garaku;If you want to protect humans and remain human, you shouldn't throw away your feelings, no matter how painful it is.;;;;;;;;
5165;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;So how about we become monsters together?.. And turn this world upside down? So that... nothing bad... or sad... would remain. Destroy, destroy, destroy it all!;;;;;;;;
5166;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;I don't want... to run away by myself. Because no matter what, I'd rather be together with everyone...;;;;;;;;
5167;(Fairy Tail);Elfman Strauss;How can a snake fly? It's not even a man!;;;;;;;;
5168;(Fairy Tail);Kagura Mikazuchi;I never rely on luck. It's all my own choice. It leads me to the future.;;;;;;;;
5169;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Takakura Shouma;"I hate the word ""fate."" Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that's all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel. Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn't amount to anything...";;;;;;;;
5170;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl!;;;;;;;;
5171;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Even though I've lost my way, I will save you.;;;;;;;;
5172;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;My companions make my heart strong. If I'm fighting for those I love, I care not what happens to this body.;;;;;;;;
5173;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Ringo Oginome;"I love the word ""fate"". Because, you know how they talk about ""fated encounters""? A single encounter can completely change your life. Such special encounters are not just coincidences. They're definitely... fate. Of course, life is not all happy encounters. There are many painful, sad moments. But this is what I think: sad and painful things definitely happen for a reason. Nothing in this world is pointless.";;;;;;;;
5174;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Kindness can bring you even bigger troubles.;;;;;;;;
5175;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;In our culture, the phenomena known as emotion is considered a mental disorder.;;;;;;;;
5176;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;Repeat. I'll repeat it for however many times I have to. Until I find the only way out.;;;;;;;;
5177;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Kyubee;If you ever feel like dying to help the universe, just let me know. I'll be waiting.;;;;;;;;
5178;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sakura Kyouko;Miracles aren't free. When you wish for hope, it creates an equivalent despair. That's how the balance of this world is preserved.;;;;;;;;
5179;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;It's all useless.;;;;;;;;
5180;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;We're fighting for our own wishes. It's normal not to get noticed or remembered.;;;;;;;;
5181;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;As long as you laugh at people's suffering, your goal will always be out of reach. If you never want to be defeated, you must first learn your own weakness, and always be kind.;;;;;;;;
5182;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Junko Kaname;You need to learn how to make mistakes before you grow up. When you are young, you can recover quickly when hurt. When you get older it's harder to make mistakes. The more responsibilities, the less mistakes you are allowed to make.;;;;;;;;
5183;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Himari Takakura;Listen up, you lowlifes who will never amount to anything!;;;;;;;;
5184;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Kanba Takakura;"Why are people born? If people are born only to suffer the hard life, is it meant as some kind of punishment? Or a cynical joke? If that's the case, animals that adhere to the survival strategies programmed in their DNA are far more elegant and simple. If there really is an existence worthy of being called a God, I want to ask him just one thing: Is there really fate in the universe? If a man ignored fate, and ignored his instincts and DNA to love someone else... Dear God, is he really human? Just wondering. I hate the word ""fate"".";;;;;;;;
5185;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Homura Akemi;With kindness comes naivete. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.;;;;;;;;
5186;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Sakura Kyouko;If you're just living for your own sake, it's all up to you. No hard feelings. No regrets.;;;;;;;;
5187;(Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica);Madoka Kaname;If someone says it's wrong to hope, I will tell them that they're wrong every time. I could tell them that countless times!;;;;;;;;
5188;(Mawaru Penguindrum);Himari Takakura;That's when I realized! That I had become a child who would be found. So I broke into tears of happiness. No matter how far we're separated, you two would definitely find me. It's nice knowing someone will find you.;;;;;;;;

5474;(Fate/zero);Rider;To win, but not destroy;;;;;;;;
5475;(Fate/zero);Emiya Kiritsugu;However, humans did not realize that truth no matter how high they staked their mountains of corpses. That's because in no matter what era the courageous and fearless great heroes have always bedazzled the eyes of the multitude with their splendid heroic legends.

5476;(Shiki);Yuuki Natsuno;It's not that I'm on the side of humans. I just really don't like you guys.;;;;;;;;
5477;(Shiki);Sunako Kirishiki;Death is terrible for anyone. Young or old, good or evil, it's all the same. Death is impartial. There is no especially terrible death. That's why death is so fearsome.

5498;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;I would be nothing without you.;;;;;;;;

5510;(Junjou Romantica);Misaki Takahashi;He is so twisted that if he sees someone wandering around lost, he's the kind of guy who will screw and toy around with the poor soul before he even bothers to help...IF he even bothers to help!;;;;;;;;
5511;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;The moment you challenged me, you had already lost.;;;;;;;;
5512;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;I am not a person who only wants to receive things from him, I want to be the person who can give things to him.;;;;;;;;
5513;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;I have a lot of different words desperately trying to get my message across. However, you, were able to pass on what you wanted to say with just a few of them.;;;;;;;;

5521;(Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi);Masamune Takano;How much more love do you need for you to accept me?;;;;;;;;
5522;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;Why you ask? That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.  The answer is obvious.  Because I want to! *to Misaki Takahashi*;;;;;;;;
5523;(Junjou Romantica);Akihiko Usami;To everything that comes near you, I am jealous.;;;;;;;;
5524;(Junjou Romantica);Misaki Takahashi;It pisses me off... Like a knife, he violates me even through my ears.;;;;;;;;

5556;(Nodame Cantabile);Noda Megumi;Senpai, take me to the art museum again. Next time, I'll carefully listen to what you say. Please feed me worms!;;;;;;;;
5557;(Nodame Cantabile);Noda Megumi;You play like you're jacking off. [about Ryuu playing piano];;;;;;;;
5558;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;The president did say please.;;;;;;;;
5559;(Cowboy Bebop);Spike Spiegel;I'm not going there to die. I'm going there to find out if I'm really alive.;;;;;;;;
5560;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;Love and Peace!;;;;;;;;
5561;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Kanade Maki;Never show your stupid self in public.;;;;;;;;
5562;(Big Windup!);Maria Momoe;Don't do something wasteful as to wash your frustrations with tears. Your frustration is motivation that you can use to make yourself better. Hold it inside like it's an important thing!;;;;;;;;
5563;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Shinji Ikari;Mankind has no time left.;;;;;;;;
5564;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Does a death wish cause you to talk to me that way?;;;;;;;;
5565;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;I'm not fighting because I want to win. I'm fighting because I have to win.;;;;;;;;
5566;(Junjou Romantica);Misaki Takahashi;The pain... the pleasure... and the shame all drive me crazy.;;;;;;;;
5567;(Ano Hi Mita Hana No Namae Wo Bokutachi Wa Mada Shiranai);Jinta Yadomi;I thought I could just apologize tomorrow. But that tomorrow... never came.;;;;;;;;
5568;(Ao no Exorcist);Reiji Shiratori;I'll rip that mouth of yours apart, so you can never again utter such spells!;;;;;;;;
5569;(Ao no Exorcist);Fujimoto Shirou;*chanting* Blessed be the Lord! For he hath heard the voice of my supplication. The Lord is my helper...and my protector. Thou shalt perish where thou standeth!;;;;;;;;
5570;(Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko);Yashiro Hoshimiya;Fool! Next time you see the sun at night, know it's your last!;;;;;;;;
5571;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;I just want to keep looking at her.;;;;;;;;
5572;(Great Teacher Onizuka);Eikichi Onizuka;It's my job to make school fun.;;;;;;;;
5573;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Love is brightest in the dark.;;;;;;;;
5574;(Hanasaku Iroha);Nako Oshimizu;Isn't it lonely when you wake up and you don't hear any voices?;;;;;;;;
5575;(Hanasaku Iroha);Minko Tsurugi;*to Ohana* You can't do everything by yourself!... But I can't do it by myself, either. I need your help.;;;;;;;;
5576;(FLCL);Naota Nandaba;I can hardly tell anymore where the truth ends and the lies begin.;;;;;;;;
5577;(Hanasaku Iroha);Ohana Matsumae;Yes, it really﻿ was a fairy tale. A pretty girl reached out her hand to me and ... told me to die!;;;;;;;;
5578;(Rurouni Kenshin);Kenshin Himura;The moment you find the courage to give up your life for someone... Would be the moment you understand love.;;;;;;;;
5579;(Paradise Kiss);Yukari Hayasaka;I'm not going to lose. No matter how hard it is, I'm not going to run away. Watch me use this hand and capture the future!;;;;;;;;
5580;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;Even I... know what it's like to be jealous.;;;;;;;;
5581;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;It's fine. I'll work hard on my own.;;;;;;;;
5582;(Lovely Complex);Atsushi Otani;Well, there's this one hopeless idiot... who'll probably end up crying if I see you again.;;;;;;;;
5583;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;Everytime Otani says or does something, I end up going to heaven, or hell.;;;;;;;;
5584;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;A comedienne is no match for an ex girlfriend.;;;;;;;;
5585;(Lovely Complex);Atsushi Otani;Don't be indecisive. Just go for it.;;;;;;;;
5586;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;This is straining my heartstrings.;;;;;;;;
5587;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;Don't ever lie, even if it's about your feelings.;;;;;;;;
5588;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;I wish I could rewrite my past.. but I can't. If I could, I'd do all I could if it would stop you from crying. But.. that's impossible. My past won't change. That's why we need to make my past pale in comparison to our present.;;;;;;;;
5589;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;I'm a little grateful to you. I wonder if I'll forget these feelings too.;;;;;;;;
5590;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;It's fine, I'll come to save you as much as you want. I'll make you fall for me as much as you wish. Leave this to your master.;;;;;;;;
5591;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;Enough. I've had enough. I'm dropping out.;;;;;;;;
5592;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;"Human memories are too vague. Thinking something has color when it doesn't, making things more dramatic than they really are, glorifying things... It gives new greater meaning than was actually there. That's why I don't believe any of this talk about ""beautiful memories"".";;;;;;;;
5593;(Durarara!!);Ryuugamine Mikado;I love clichés, I love predictable scripts, I love it when they paste over problems and I love it when they force a happy ending too. What's wrong with working towards that?;;;;;;;;
5594;(K-ON!);Sawako Yamanaka;No, she's hiding something. But what could it be? Snacks? Guitar? Wait, maybe ton-chan.;;;;;;;;
5595;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;It's painful when you get disappointed by the person you look up to.;;;;;;;;
5596;(K-ON!);Sawako Yamanaka;I'll be waiting for you to get your asses back here!;;;;;;;;
5597;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;Well, I won't be disappointed, no matter what you do.;;;;;;;;
5598;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;I guess I'm a girl who lacks self-awareness as one, or just too manly, eh?;;;;;;;;
5599;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;Usui, you perverted, outer spaceman human being!;;;;;;;;
5600;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Soutarou Kanou;I really don't get it. Why don't you tell her how you feel if you care for her so much? Why would you lie like that and keep yourself from pursuing her?;;;;;;;;
5601;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;I don't know much about you. You were the one who selfishly entered my world...yet you immediately plunged into silence. What were you thinking? Did you really pick on me just because it was fun? Which one is serious and which one of it is just a joke? That's enough now, making me all messed up like this.;;;;;;;;
5602;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Misaki Ayuzawa;About Usui, I really don't know anything at all. It's mortifying... Yet I already don't want him to turn away.;;;;;;;;
5603;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;That's exactly the way it should be. Doing only unexpected things, otherwise, I'll lose my reputation as a perverted outer-space human.;;;;;;;;
5604;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;If it is with Ayuzawa, whatever I do, wherever I am, I am happy. So it's okay.;;;;;;;;
5605;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;I'm actually a hardcore otaku who likes maids more than having three meals a day. And I only read books related to maids. Also, I only visit maid cafes. Of course, I also collect maid figurines. I play games which feature female maids and it turns me on so much. Then I wear maid uniforms and jump in joy. I'll take my leave now.;;;;;;;;
5606;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;I don't want others to hear the words that I've been waiting anxiously for... I want to be the only one to hear them.;;;;;;;;
5607;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;It's okay, no need to thank me or say anything else. I will always be there for you, I will make you fall for me over and over again.;;;;;;;;
5608;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;Walking along the path that she chose, without being affected by others... in this sense, white is her color...in another sense, it also makes me want to put more colors on her.;;;;;;;;
5609;(Seirei No Moribito);Balsa;If you have money, life is the same no matter where you go. But if you don't have money, your life can adapt to where you are.;;;;;;;;
5610;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;Ayuzawa, you are the first person ever to appear in my life and able to make me a mess.;;;;;;;;
5611;(Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama!);Takumi Usui;How far do you want me to suppress myself so that you'll be satisfied?;;;;;;;;
5612;(FLCL);Naota Nandaba;Nothing amazing happens here. Only the ordinary.;;;;;;;;
5613;(FLCL);Mamimi Samejima;...Watermelon. Or like a panda with a mean face, or like sandals with pressure points drawn on them, or the smell of a blackboard eraser, or a Sunday morning where you wake up and it's raining. Well, I like him more than hard bread.;;;;;;;;
5614;(FLCL);Mamimi Samejima;[a giant satellite bomb is headed towards the city] If that thing hits, do you think we'll have school tomorrow?;;;;;;;;
5615;(FLCL);Haruko Haruhara;Please don't tell people our bakery's motorbike ran you over.;;;;;;;;
5616;(FLCL);Haruko Haruhara;It takes an idiot to do cool things. That's why it's cool.;;;;;;;;
5617;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Face it kid, I'm much too big of a guy for you to handle and you know it. Do you see how the very ground shakes beneath me feet?;;;;;;;;
5618;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Can I shoot them now?;;;;;;;;
5619;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;He's seriously crazy, he must be insane.;;;;;;;;
5620;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;Now you're suddenly in a big rush to go? What's the point in hurrying, we're already three hours late.;;;;;;;;
5621;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Black Star, it's over between us.;;;;;;;;
5622;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;*points at Black Star* What is that? Some kind of monkey? Yeah...it must be a monkey.;;;;;;;;
5623;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;The last time I let you do my eyebrows it took you a month.;;;;;;;;
5624;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;That is why I prefer using you two pistols. There is symmetry to wielding you two, right? (Getting aggravated) But when you two are in human form, your hairstyles and your heights are completely different... (Grabs their breasts) Even your cup sizes are completely different!;;;;;;;;
5625;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;This guy's a special kind of stupid.;;;;;;;;
5626;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Ooops....My finger slipped.;;;;;;;;
5627;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Man this guy is stupid, ugly and a bad shooter.;;;;;;;;
5628;(Soul Eater);Black Star;You should quake in fear of your impending death.;;;;;;;;
5629;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;So, you don't like to get hit, huh? Well, you're about to have a very bad day.;;;;;;;;
5630;(Dragon Ball);Trunks Brief;You're about to find out what it's like to fight a real super saiyan...and I'm not talking about Goku.;;;;;;;;
5631;(Claymore);Teresa;This young girl, whose small body is only half the size of mine, has taught me that tears can flow from these silver eyes.;;;;;;;;
5632;(Saiyuki);Cho Hakkai;Regrets are just a way for the foolish and the guilty to pass time.;;;;;;;;
5633;(Da Capo II);Yoshiyuki Sakurai;Humans are creatures that dream. Different from others, they want to be special. They want to be adored by others, just like the heroes in comics and games, achieving great things with unique powers. Of course, no one ever believes deep down it will happen. Everyone knows there's no magic in this world.;;;;;;;;
5634;(Blood+);Saya Otonashi;D-mn! I just stepped in a pile of chiroptoran sh-t!;;;;;;;;
5635;(Blood+);Haji;Chicks dig guys in black.;;;;;;;;
5636;(Blood+);George Miyagusuku;Saya, no matter what happens, do what you believe is right. Accept your past. And if you trip, remember nankurunasia. Live through today for tomorrow's sake.;;;;;;;;
5637;(Blood+);Kai Miyagusuku;No matter what happens, you are still you...our family.;;;;;;;;
5638;(Blood+);Kai Miyagusuku;I'll do what I can, because I'm desperate.;;;;;;;;
5639;(Blood+);Haji;There is no guarantee that your dreams are just good ones.;;;;;;;;
5640;(Blood+);Nathan Mahler;There is only a fine line separating art from madness.;;;;;;;;
5641;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;(In response to Seaman's question) When real men do what they're supposed to, it's not always about what they want.;;;;;;;;
5642;(Angel Beats!);Shiina;Ever since that day, I've kept this broom balanced on my fingertip.;;;;;;;;
5643;(Angel Beats!);Yui;She's an idiot, right?;;;;;;;;
5644;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;I'm pretty confident about my reflexes. And pretty strong too. I'm a guy after all. When the time comes, I can protect you even at the cost of my life.;;;;;;;;
5645;(Angel Beats!);TK;Crazy baby.;;;;;;;;
5646;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Shinji Ikari;[after masturbating over Asuka's comatose body] I'm so fucked up.;;;;;;;;
5647;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Kaworu Nagisa;Songs are good. Singing brings us joy. It is the highest point in the culture that Lilims have created.;;;;;;;;
5648;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Souryuu Asuka Langley;My mind is being eaten away... Kaji-san, it's unravelling my mind! What do I do? It's defiling my mind!;;;;;;;;
5649;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Souryuu Asuka Langley;[naked and smiling at Shinji] Hey Shinji, you idiot! Want to become of one mind and one body?;;;;;;;;
5650;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;I wonder how you're suppose to give up... Do I just decide to give up and act accordingly? And move further and further away from what my heart really wants? Then will I forget everything one day?.. Everything including the pain in my heart? Everything? Without a trace as if nothing was there to begin with?;;;;;;;;
5651;(5 Centimeters per Second);Takaki Toono;It must really be a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine. Cutting through absolute darkness, encountering nothing but the occasional hydrogen atom. Flying blindly into the abyss, believing therein lie the answers to the mysteries of the universe.;;;;;;;;
5652;(5 Centimeters per Second);Takaki Toono;The things I had to tell her...The things I hoped she would listen to...There were so many of them.;;;;;;;;
5653;(5 Centimeters per Second);Takaki Toono;Every minute felt like an eternity time, clearly as if it had malicious intent, slowly ebbed away from me, I clenched my teeth and keeping myself from crying was the only thing I could do...;;;;;;;;
5654;(5 Centimeters per Second);Akari Shinohara;Hey... They say it's five centimeters per second. *Takaki asks her what she means by that* The speed at which the sakura blossom petals fall... Five centimeters per second.;;;;;;;;
5655;(5 Centimeters per Second);Takaki Toono;At what speed must I live...to be able to see you again..?;;;;;;;;
5656;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Sakura Kinomoto;You are the most important person to me in the whole wide world.;;;;;;;;
5657;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Sakura Kinomoto;Uhh.. Syaoran.. it's okay if you don't have any more feelings for me, that doesn't matter to me at all. But I'm in love with you and I just wanted you to know, that's all.;;;;;;;;
5658;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Syaoran Li;Even if this feeling important to me disappears...I'll feel this way about you again.;;;;;;;;
5659;(Bleach);Arisawa Tatsuki;What a punchline, no... that was just a punch.;;;;;;;;
5660;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;Dammit, I'll show you who's more skilled with his language skills!;;;;;;;;
5661;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;So he killed my father and murdered my people. That means nothing to me. Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else is just a delusion for the weak.;;;;;;;;
5662;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Ritsuko Akagi;The interaction of men and women isn't very logical.;;;;;;;;
5663;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Touji Suzuhara;It's overpriced, but that's okay, HERE'S YOUR CHANGE!;;;;;;;;
5664;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Misato Katsuragi;This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable. And take advantage of everything here, except me.;;;;;;;;
5665;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Rei Ayanami;Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire. He creates life by diminishing the Darkness.;;;;;;;;
5666;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Misato Katsuragi;Survivability takes priority.;;;;;;;;
5667;(Neon Genesis Evangelion);Ryoji Kaji;Understanding 100% of everything is impossible. That's why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. That's what makes life so interesting.;;;;;;;;
5668;(Hellsing);Jan Valentine;Up, up! Down, down! Left, right, left, right! Bringing the motherfucking death by Konami! Ahh I'm so fucking hard right now! [laughs];;;;;;;;
5669;(Hellsing);Jan Valentine;Little Hellsing chicky, I'm coming to find you. Come out and play, little Hellsing. It's going to be a lot of fun. We just want to torture you, kill you, maybe skullfuck your corpse a couple of times, burn your house to the ground, go home, and masturbate, okay?;;;;;;;;
5670;(Hellsing);Jan Valentine;Hey bitch, get off me! I'm supposed to be on top!;;;;;;;;
5671;(Hellsing);Alucard;Such a shame. I overestimated you. As a vampire, you were just a pathetic piece of shit. And now you're nothing but dog shit!;;;;;;;;
5672;(Hellsing);Walter C. Dornez;I highly recommend pissing yourself followed by a course of praying to your impotent god.;;;;;;;;
5673;(Hellsing);Seras Victoria;A four-poster coffin. Bloody hell.;;;;;;;;
5674;(Hellsing);Integra Hellsing;I'm surrounded by idiots.;;;;;;;;
5675;(Hellsing);Integra Hellsing;You're too loud, Police Girl. I don't care if you're a vampire, you're still English. Have some manners.;;;;;;;;
5676;(Hellsing);Seras Victoria;Eat Harkonnen, bitch!;;;;;;;;
5677;(Hellsing);Integra Hellsing;They're... eating my people!;;;;;;;;
5678;(Hellsing);Alucard;Immortality is wasted on the young.;;;;;;;;
5679;(Hellsing);Alucard;Have you ever wondered, Master, what it feels like to be hunted?;;;;;;;;
5680;(Hellsing);Integra Hellsing;These monsters dare to enter this house built on blood and honor! I will see them all roast in the deepest pits of Hell!;;;;;;;;
5681;(Hellsing);Alucard;Eternity is wasted upon the likes of you. Try as you might, immortality slips away. And you remain with only your shame.;;;;;;;;
5682;(Hellsing);Alucard;Beautiful night, isn't it, Police Girl? It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.;;;;;;;;
5683;(Hellsing);Integra Hellsing;[clenches Fist] No matter how intelligent or how strong they are still nothing but vampire trash.;;;;;;;;
5684;(Hellsing);Alucard;You are a fool who creates slaves to do your dirty work. A coward and an incompetent, incapable of doing anything on your own. You are not worthy of the lowest pits of Hell!;;;;;;;;
5685;(Spirited Away);Chihiro Ogino;[To Yubaba] I'm not leaving until you give me a job!;;;;;;;;
5686;(Spirited Away);Chihiro Ogino;It's just...a bad dream! Wake up, wake up...;;;;;;;;
5687;(Spirited Away);Haku;[To Chihiro as she's sleeping] Meet me at the bridge. Come alone.;;;;;;;;
5688;(Spirited Away);Haku;Three days of eating our food and her smell will go away. And if she doesn't work hard, roast her, boil her, do whatever you want. Now get back to work!;;;;;;;;
5689;(Spirited Away);Chihiro Ogino;I finally get a bouquet and it's a goodbye present. That's depressing.;;;;;;;;
5690;(Berserk);Guts;FUCK YOU. I'm human, the real deal, right down to the fuckin' marrow of my bones. Don't lump me together with you faggot-ass monsters.;;;;;;;;
5691;(Berserk);Guts;If you're always worried about crushing the ants beneath you... you won't be able to walk.;;;;;;;;
5692;(Berserk);Griffith;Death on the battlefield comes regardless of class, royal or common. The loser must die!;;;;;;;;
5693;(Berserk);Guts;In the end the winner is still the last man standing.;;;;;;;;
5694;(Berserk);Guts;I don't want what another man can give me. If he grants me anything, then it's his to give and not my own.;;;;;;;;
5695;(Berserk);Guts;Could you settle for a smile, and a fond farewell?;;;;;;;;
5696;(Berserk);Griffith;For me to call a man my friend, he must be equal to me in all respects.;;;;;;;;
5697;(Berserk);Guts;I'd rather fight for my life than live it.;;;;;;;;
5698;(Berserk);Guts;Throughout my life, the moments, and people who have defined me... they have all been illuminated by sparks.;;;;;;;;
5699;(Berserk);Griffith;A dream... It's something you do for yourself, not for others.;;;;;;;;
5700;(Berserk);Guts;He appeared right in front of me, and he wasn't a demon... but what looked like a human. As if he'd been yanked from before into the present unchanged. I gazed at him and for a second... I forgot to kill him.;;;;;;;;
5701;(Berserk);Guts;I want out of this damn moat!;;;;;;;;
5702;(Berserk);Guts;When you meet your God tell him to leave me alone.;;;;;;;;
5703;(Berserk);Guts;You have the strongest armour, because you are the weakest!;;;;;;;;
5704;(Berserk);Guts;My place really was here. I was too foolish and stubborn to notice. But, what I truly hoped for then was here. Why do I always realize it... when I've already lost it.;;;;;;;;
5705;(Berserk);Guts;You're going to be all right. You just stumbled over a stone in the road. It means nothing. Your goal lies far beyond this. Doesn't it? I'm sure you'll overcome this. You'll walk again... soon.;;;;;;;;
5706;(Berserk);Griffith;Stake your lives on this fight! Our survival demands that we stake our lives on this fight! And to survive, is to be victorious!;;;;;;;;
5707;(Berserk);Guts;Every sword belongs in its sheath. Go back to the sheath your master holds. Go back to Griffith.;;;;;;;;
5708;(Berserk);Guts;Humans are weak... but we want to live. Even if we're wounded... or tortured... we feel the pain.;;;;;;;;
5709;(Berserk);Guts;Do whatever you want now. But if you disturb me, I'll kill you.;;;;;;;;
5710;(Berserk);Griffith;A friend would not just follow another's dream... a friend would find his own reason to live.;;;;;;;;
5711;(Berserk);Guts;Let's have a drink. Hh shut up... The alcohol will disinfect me from the inside!;;;;;;;;
5712;(Berserk);Griffith;Among thousands of comrades and ten thousand enemies, only you... only you made me forget my dream. I see it!;;;;;;;;
5713;(Berserk);Guts;You're right, we are mortal and fragile. But even if we are tortured or wounded, we'll fight to survive. You should feel the pain we feel and understand. I am the messenger that will deliver you to that pain and understanding.;;;;;;;;
5714;(Lovely Complex);Risa Koizumi;An oasis for my withered heart in this harsh reality.;;;;;;;;
5715;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;Thanks a lot, dream wrecker.;;;;;;;;
5716;(Soul Eater);Crona;I bet dead people are easier to get along with.;;;;;;;;
5717;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Just look at it Liz, Patti, just look at how the clouds are! Flowing right towards the sun! It's so beautiful, even the sky is symmetrical!;;;;;;;;
5718;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Victory and Glory!;;;;;;;;
5719;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;About the 1,000 provisions that you are required to observe. Now I would like for you to participate in the most important provision. Number 452 the 5 hour story telling party.;;;;;;;;
5720;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Reaper Combat Art: Mortal Sin Stance.;;;;;;;;
5721;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Excalibur! Excalibur! From the United K! I'm looking for heaven! I'm going to California!;;;;;;;;
5722;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;You disgust me. I am a Grim Reaper, I refuse to grant anyone the freedom to kill!;;;;;;;;
5723;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;FOOL! As someone who is unaware of the vital role that singing has played in the cultural history of mankind you are in no position to question me. Remember that the next time you stop to consider your place in this world. You do not possess the power to deny a singer his song. Do you understand what I'm telling you?;;;;;;;;
5724;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Thus at long last the fighting between the rival gangs had ended! To sum up, this leads us to number 778 of the 1,000 provisions you must observe. Never mail a letter without the return address or the proper postage. And don't call collect.;;;;;;;;
5725;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I'm going to keep fighting until this world is the way it should be. Until the world is balanced.;;;;;;;;
5726;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;I was all dried up. Yes, nothing could satisfy me anymore. I was but a shell of a man. An unspeakable emptiness grew deep within my heart. I became frustrated, sad, hollow. The gapping hole inside of me was growing larger everyday. Slowly consuming me from the inside out. At least until that day came.;;;;;;;;
5727;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;To sum up, that is what led to number 679 of the 1,000 provisions you must observe. Always place a dehumidifier in your room.;;;;;;;;
5728;(Soul Eater);Crona;I can't lose weight, I don't know how to deal with being any skinnier than I already am.;;;;;;;;
5729;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I do not deny evil, nor do I believe that any human is completely free of malice. Everything must be in balance. As long as evil and good maintain an equilibrium in this world, there is no problem. Perfect balance is the key to everything.;;;;;;;;
5730;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;"SILENCE! This is number 349 of the 1,000 provisions you must observe. Meisters should eat everything regardless of personal likes and dislikes. Never say anything as selfish as ""I don't like carrots."" again.";;;;;;;;
5731;(Soul Eater);Crona;I hate, hate, hate everyone.;;;;;;;;
5732;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I partnered with these two specifically so something like this wouldn't happen. I need symmetry! Maybe I should have listened to my father. He tried to pick out a good weapon for me, but I refused to listen to him! Stubborn! All I cared about, all I wanted was symmetry! Two symmetrical weapons! Was that so much to ask for?! And now all my efforts have been completely and utterly wasted! Damn it!;;;;;;;;
5733;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;This brings us to number 278 of the 1,000 provisions you must observe. I hate carrots. Never even think about putting them in my food, you get it?;;;;;;;;
5734;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;It's quite basic actually, perhaps the simplest of tricks there is. True it may not seem so simple from an ordinary persons point of view, some people may even consider it a baffling, utterly perplexing problem. Things will often appear complicated on the outside while in truth they are simplicity itself. Of course how one sees these things depends on the person, many people find there is a fine line separating the complex to the very simple.;;;;;;;;
5735;(Soul Eater);Crona;I'm scared of everyone. I need to learn to deal with people better.;;;;;;;;
5736;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Get your ass moving Kid!;;;;;;;;
5737;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;If you want to do damage to the other ship you have to ram them in the middle! Now do it again!;;;;;;;;
5738;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;One must take time to think! Rushing forward without considering things beforehand is the hight of foolishness. Ahh yes, that reminds me of another time when I had to consider things, that case was long ago but I remember it still. It was back when I still hung my hat on Bakers St. and called it home.;;;;;;;;
5739;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Thus I found myself carrying the entire weight of the troop as I preformed my dance before a capacity crowd at the opera house.;;;;;;;;
5740;(Soul Eater);Crona;There are stars and planets floating around me. I don't think I could handle astronomy right now.;;;;;;;;
5741;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.;;;;;;;;
5742;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;We're hunting after a legendary sword. Finding a fairy or two shouldn't be surprising.;;;;;;;;
5743;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;A symphony can not be created using common sense and probabilities. It is already written in the fate of the composer. No... that's not it. A symphony is the inevitable result of a bad childhood, deafness, and too many beans eaten after a certain time of day.;;;;;;;;
5744;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Humming and the nightly news share a very tight connection indeed.;;;;;;;;
5745;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;You know about it, don't you, Witch Medusa? About the Kishin beneath the DWMA.;;;;;;;;
5746;(Soul Eater);Crona;Thumbtacks in my shoes would stick into my feet whenever I tried to walk. It would hurt. I don't think I could deal with that really.;;;;;;;;
5747;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;You better watch out! I can break your neck!;;;;;;;;
5748;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I'll ward off the water from above, can you handle the water on the ground? We'll work together, it's a good thing there are two of us here. This plan would be impossible alone. Quite an obstacle.;;;;;;;;
5749;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Black Star, I can't come down, there's water. Carry me.;;;;;;;;
5750;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Number 58 of the 1,000 provisions I would like you to observe, never talk to me while I'm humming to myself. This is an important provision do you understand?;;;;;;;;
5751;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Of course they are my family, isn't it obvious? And a wonderful family they were. It happened long ago when I was still in the flower of my youth. The cities began to grow wild, people lost hope for the future, they became lazy idol time wasters. And to my everlasting shame I was no exception. Thus I began to watch the 7 O'Clock news religiously every night!;;;;;;;;
5752;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;This is fear. That's good then, I had forgotten what it felt like.;;;;;;;;
5753;(Soul Eater);Crona;I've never seen a man with a screw sticking out of his head before. I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with a guy like that!;;;;;;;;
5754;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Giraffe! Giraffe! I love Giraffes!;;;;;;;;
5755;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Yeah it's going to be freaking awesome!;;;;;;;;
5756;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;We were born as weapons and we loved the power that came with it. Nothing could scare us. We walked around town like we owned the place, taking whatever we wanted whenever we wanted it. No one ever thought to ask what our lives were really like.;;;;;;;;
5757;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;What If I didn't fold the toilet paper? Something like that could ruin my life forever. I can't be defeated by toilet paper, if I turn my back on this I shouldn't be allowed to live anymore.;;;;;;;;
5758;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;That's right, I said destory it.;;;;;;;;
5759;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Hey! Hold on, come back! I'll tell you what! I can lower those 1,000 provisions down to 800, just as long as you take part in the five hour story telling party.;;;;;;;;
5760;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Before becoming my Meister there is a list of 1,000 provisions you must peruse. Be sure to look through all of them, they're important. I greatly look forward to your participation in number 452 the five hour story telling party.;;;;;;;;
5761;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;Ha ha ha ha! Promise me something, if you're gonna sue, go after the spirit first, okay?;;;;;;;;
5762;(Soul Eater);Crona;I don't like it, the dark circles under my eyes will come back and I don't know how to deal with the dark circles!;;;;;;;;
5763;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Hey sis, I've been wondering. How come everyone always closes their eyes when they sneeze? Is it to keep their eyes from popping out of their heads?;;;;;;;;
5764;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;I can see through you, you're lying, you want to gobble up my hot body!;;;;;;;;
5765;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I'm a pig, a louse, a useless cow! I destroyed Anubis! Such utter garbage cannot be allowed to live! I deserve to die!;;;;;;;;
5766;(Soul Eater);Elizabeth Thompson;A sound soul dwells within sound skin and sound cuticles.;;;;;;;;
5767;(Soul Eater);Patricia Thompson;Yeah Kid you're not garbage. If you were garbage you would smell a lot worse so why don't we just get up and try again okay?;;;;;;;;
5768;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;No I can't go on like this! I should die! How could this happen? Did I really forget to fold the tip of the toilet paper into a triangle?;;;;;;;;
5769;(Soul Eater);Crona;I'mma... I'm not very good at talking with girls. They make me nervous.;;;;;;;;
5770;(Soul Eater);Crona;This much I know, my blood is black.;;;;;;;;
5771;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;Are you helping because you're a doctor? Or is it because you're a Witch?;;;;;;;;
5772;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Nothing beats a cup of herbal tea in the morning.;;;;;;;;
5773;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;My legend dates back to the 12th Century you see. My legend is quite old. The 12th Century was a long time ago.;;;;;;;;
5774;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;*chuckles* Looks like your little kitties failed. The taste of victory is very sweet!;;;;;;;;
5775;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;You're horrible! Commenting on my appearance like that! I don't have to listen to this from you! It's sexual harassment!;;;;;;;;
5776;(Soul Eater);Eruka Frog;Free, we gotta inject the Black Blood into the Kishin, if we don't then Medusa is gonna slaughter us!;;;;;;;;
5777;(Soul Eater);Blair;Pum, Pum, Pum, Pum. I always get what I want, so just give it to me. Pum, Pum, Pum, Pum. I'm a beauty, beautiful pretty lady. But you know, you know I've got a secret yes I do. Pumpkins, Pum, Pum, Pumpkins. Pum, Pum, Pumpkins because that's my magic spell. Pum, Pum, Pumpkins, Pum, Pum, Pumpkins yeah!;;;;;;;;
5778;(Soul Eater);Blair;Pum, Pumkins, Smashing Pumkins!;;;;;;;;
5779;(Soul Eater);Eruka Frog;It's so lovely to have been born a Witch.;;;;;;;;
5780;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;You don't feel as good on my foot now, change yourself back into a frog.;;;;;;;;
5781;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Young ones! Do you want to hear the legend of me? Do you want to hear a heroic tale?;;;;;;;;
5782;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;I think I'd like to dissect you now!;;;;;;;;
5783;(Soul Eater);Crona;The doors here only open one way. They open inward.;;;;;;;;
5784;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;You're disgustingly hideous! What the hell kind of thing are you? I've never seen anything more messed up in my life! Do you know nothing about symmetry? Whoever made you should be dug up from his grave, shot and reburied! You make me violently ill.;;;;;;;;
5785;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Tornado Flip!;;;;;;;;
5786;(Soul Eater);Blair;Oh! My little scythey boy!;;;;;;;;
5787;(Soul Eater);Eruka Frog;Next time I really am going to kill you Medusa ribbit!;;;;;;;;
5788;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;It will be alright, have faith in yourself. Crona, you will be a Kishin.;;;;;;;;
5789;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;No autographs!;;;;;;;;
5790;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;Welcome. Welcome to my cave young ones. Please forgive the belated salutations I am the holy sword Excalibur!;;;;;;;;
5791;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;All the more reason to dissect one, before the whole species dies off.;;;;;;;;
5792;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Symmetry is key everything must be esthetically pleasing. That's why I use the two of you as twin pistols in order to preserve symmetry. When I hold you both I'm completely balanced on the right and left. It isn't perfect because your human forms are so different from each other though. Your hair styles and height for example. Even your boobs are different sizes!;;;;;;;;
5793;(Soul Eater);Blair;I never said I was a witch did I? You just made that assumption all on your own. I'm really just a cat with a ridiculous amount of magical power.;;;;;;;;
5794;(Soul Eater);Eruka Frog;I can't stand that witch, stupid snake woman.;;;;;;;;
5795;(Soul Eater);Eruka Frog;Ribbit.;;;;;;;;
5796;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;Um well Miss Maka? Can you do me a favor and help me out with your father? I can't get him off my leg.;;;;;;;;
5797;(Soul Eater);Medusa Gorgon;Nake, Snake, Cobra, Cobra.;;;;;;;;
5798;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;My mornings begin with a cup of coffee with cream at the cafe. My afternoon begins with hot tea with two lumps of sugar. And my evenings... In the evening I change into my pajamas.;;;;;;;;
5799;(Soul Eater);Excalibur;My legend dates back to the 12th Century thank you very much.;;;;;;;;
5800;(Soul Eater);Franken Stein;I can't seem to get my head on straight.;;;;;;;;
5801;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;No, it can't be 7, say 8 damn it! 8 is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number 7 in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be 8 instead! 8 cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back I beg of you! Please say 8, PLEASE!;;;;;;;;
5802;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I'm an abomination! I'm filthy and dirty! And unbalanced! Why is there only one set of stripes?! I'm garbage! Asymmetrical garbage! I deserve to die!;;;;;;;;
5803;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;Symmetry is what makes the world beautiful.;;;;;;;;
5804;(One Piece);Dr hiluluk;When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!? No! It’s when... they are forgotten.;;;;;;;;
5805;(One Piece);Enel;I am lightning. No matter how hard they try, mankind can never overcome lightning. Since ancient times, mankind has labeled the unknowns of nature as God. And anything they could not understand, they feared. Everything which befalls mankind is said to be the work of God. Mankind accepts that it cannot defeat natural disasters. And I am one of them.;;;;;;;;
5806;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;If I told her how I feel, she'd miss me even more. Afterall, I'm the guy who keeps breaking her heart by making her wait an eternity... even though I'm always by her side. I don't wanna see her cry anymore. Even if it means I no longer have a place in her heart. Seems pretty childish of me, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;
5807;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Are you scared? I understand. The first time I saw my reflection in the mirror, even I was frightened by how BIG my reflection was.;;;;;;;;
5808;(Soul Eater);Death the Kid;I'm worthless garbage who can't even write a straight looking K!;;;;;;;;
5809;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;Human is an existence full of sin.;;;;;;;;
5810;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Any technique is worthless before my eyes.;;;;;;;;
5811;(Death Note);Ryuk;The human world is a boring place with boring people doing boring things.;;;;;;;;
5812;(Death Note);L Lawliet;The bells are very loud today.;;;;;;;;
5813;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Hibari Kyoya;"The word ""discipline"" is something that I would never give up, no matter what. But it's not because it is my pride that I will not give it up. It's because I cannot give it up, that's why it is my pride.";;;;;;;;
5814;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;This is vengeance, so I am to ferry you to hell.;;;;;;;;
5815;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;When one person is cursed, two graves are dug.;;;;;;;;
5816;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;I will become a bigger badass than my father. And a stronger shinobi than my mother!;;;;;;;;
5817;(Soul Eater);Black Star;You don't understand anything, do you?! The most important thing isn't power, it isn't courage, it isn't even having friends! The only thing that matters is that you can rely on ME.;;;;;;;;
5818;(Soul Eater);Crona;Do you know where hell is? Inside your head.;;;;;;;;
5819;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Hibari Kyoya;It's the sky...that allows the clouds to move about freely.;;;;;;;;
5820;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;If it's something I can only cry about in my heart, it's almost like a sin.;;;;;;;;
5821;(Full Metal Panic!);Sousuke Sagara;Yes I've used a condom before. They can store up to 1 liter of water.;;;;;;;;
5822;(Full Metal Panic!);Sousuke Sagara;[pulls a gun on a boy harassing Kaname] I'll let you go this time but if I see you doing this again, I'll come after you and all your relatives.;;;;;;;;
5823;(Full Metal Panic!);Sousuke Sagara;[to a dating simulation that has just dumped him] Wait! If you cut off negotiations, it can only lead to war. Accept a truce, and I will listen to whatever you have to say. Let's work toward a compromise!;;;;;;;;
5824;(Full Metal Panic!);Kaname Chidori;I don't have any regrets. I'm glad I met you, Sousuke Sagara.;;;;;;;;
5825;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Athrun Zala;Using a rescued civilian as a hostage? So do you still feel justified in fighting by their side with these cowards? Kira?;;;;;;;;
5826;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Dearka Elsman;Seems appropriate for Nicol. A weapon fit for a coward.;;;;;;;;
5827;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Kira Yamato;What the hell can you hope to protect when your feelings are the only weapons you've got?;;;;;;;;
5828;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;You always seem to get in my way, Mu La Flaga. Though I imagine you'd say the same about me.;;;;;;;;
5829;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Kira Yamato;If I have the power to make a difference, I should put it to good use.;;;;;;;;
5830;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;But your kindess doesn't come from being a Coordinator... it's because of who you are Mr. Yamato;;;;;;;;
5831;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Sai Argyle;What a lovely voice! But I have to wonder though... is that voice a result of fiddling around with her genes?;;;;;;;;
5832;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Athrun Zala;I can't exactly fight a war with a big smile on my face.;;;;;;;;
5833;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;Nicol was fifteen. He loved the piano and Kira just cut him down.;;;;;;;;
5834;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;[to Athrun] What is it you believe in? What is it you're fighting for now? Is it for that medal you received? Or your father's orders?;;;;;;;;
5835;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Lacus Clyne;From now on, Lacus Clyne will be singing the song of peace.;;;;;;;;
5836;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Athrun Zala;Athrun Zala. Justice. Launching!;;;;;;;;
5837;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;[about Rau] But are you sure that's me? Oh well. He will be my successor in any case. Why should that woman's child be my heir? Keep a close eye on him and educate him well. Whatever you do, don't make him into another weakling.;;;;;;;;
5838;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Kira Yamato;[Kira thinks he has just killed Andrew Waltfeld and cries] It didn't have to end like this.;;;;;;;;
5839;(Katekyo Hitman Reborn!);Tsunayoshi Sawada;I don't know how to give up!!;;;;;;;;
5840;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;In the end, aren't they just a bunch of weaklings?;;;;;;;;
5841;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;I HATE LEEKS!!!;;;;;;;;
5842;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Muruta Azrael;It's simple. Even a single Coordinator is a threat to the Earth's survival, and our goal here is to get rid of them all!;;;;;;;;
5843;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Dearka Elsman;I can't just quietly follow orders when it looks like all we're trying to do is wipe out every last Natural alive.;;;;;;;;
5844;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Natarle Badgiruel;You're a monster who deserves to die, right here, with me.;;;;;;;;
5845;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;"Why torment yourself saying, ""Eventually, someday?"" How long have you been fighting with your thoughts clouded by that brand of sweet poison?";;;;;;;;
5846;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;[as he prepares to fire on the Eternal with Lacus Clyne on board] It's a shame really, I did enjoy your songs. But the real world isn't as kind as the one in pop songs!;;;;;;;;
5847;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;I'll give it a try. Anything that man can do, I'm sure I can do just as well.;;;;;;;;
5848;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Do you think you can change what's going to happen? Nobody can do anything about it. The whirlpool of hatred is engulfing the universe!;;;;;;;;
5849;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;I am the only one who's earned that right in the entire universe! I alone have the right to judge all of humanity!;;;;;;;;
5850;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;The final door is about to open! And I am the one opening it! Then the world that we know of will come to an end! This world of insatiable desires will end!;;;;;;;;
5851;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;I am He, that arrogant fool who thought he could fool death itself with his money. Al Da Flaga, your father, but I am merely that man's defective clone.;;;;;;;;
5852;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;They thirsted for knowledge! They sought to fulfill their desires! And ultimately, they forgot why they were doing it. Even as they proclaimed their reverence for human life, they began toying with it, and then they began destroying it!;;;;;;;;
5853;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;[To Kira] You are the dream of humanity, the Ultimate Coordinator. It was in pursuit of that dream that Dr. Hibiki created the artificial womb. And you are the only viable child it ever produced. For that result, a very large number of your siblings were sacrificed.;;;;;;;;
5854;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Aren't you the least bit curious? About the ultimate extent of humanity's insatiable desires? About the fools who pursued their insane dream in the name of progress? Because after all, Kira, you're a child of this too.;;;;;;;;
5855;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;"If it's my fate to be shot down by you, I thought this place would be appropriate... However, it doesn't look like there's any chance of that happening. After all, how could the ""child"" ever hope to defeat the ""parent""?";;;;;;;;
5856;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Shani Andras;Why you little... nobody takes a shot at me!;;;;;;;;
5857;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Nobody is ever born into this world as a soldier.;;;;;;;;
5858;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Yzak Joule;What's so fun about firing at targets that aren't moving?;;;;;;;;
5859;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Cagalli Yula Athha;[to Athrun] I bet your head is like a hamster running in its wheel right about now.;;;;;;;;
5860;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Athrun Zala;Kira... what are you thinking about, now?;;;;;;;;
5861;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;I went with raven for a long bathroom break.;;;;;;;;
5862;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;It's something that appear on the chests of illegal contractees.;;;;;;;;
5863;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;Illegal contractees kill people to be able to change the past.;;;;;;;;
5864;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;I wonder why illegal contractees try to kill people?;;;;;;;;
5865;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;Hey, Oz. what are you lazing around for?;;;;;;;;
5866;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;Don't tell me what to do, you seaweed head.;;;;;;;;
5867;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Irony abounds in warfare.;;;;;;;;
5868;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Kira Yamato;I may be able to operate the mobile suit... but that doesn't mean I know how to fight a battle!;;;;;;;;
5869;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Miguel Aiman;Athrun! Show us that same spirit that made you defy orders!;;;;;;;;
5870;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Kira Yamato;What you say may be correct, that there is a war going on outside our world. But we don't agree with it! We dislike war! And that is why we chose to be here, in neutral territory!;;;;;;;;
5871;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Mu, I'd actually be pleased if you'd vanish right about now!;;;;;;;;
5872;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;You always seem to get in my way, Mu La Flaga! Though I imagine you would probably say the same about me!;;;;;;;;
5873;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Murrue Ramius;You kids don't understand anything! By declaring that you're neutral and have nothing to do with this, you can still distance yourselves from what's happening? You don't really believe that, do you?;;;;;;;;
5874;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;Tell me, do you feel my presence? Do you sense it the same way that I sense yours? A rather unfortunate twist of fate, wouldn't you say... Mu La Flaga?;;;;;;;;
5875;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Rau Le Creuset;It seems we have an unforseen problem. A rather annoying fly buzzing around.;;;;;;;;
5876;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Miguel Aiman;Damn piece of Earth trash!;;;;;;;;
5877;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Miguel Aiman;Trying to pilot that mobile suit? You're in way over your head, Natural!;;;;;;;;
5878;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Miguel Aiman;It doesn't matter how good your armor is... if you can barely move!;;;;;;;;
5879;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Cagalli Yula Athha;I knew it. The Earth Forces' new mobile weapons. Father, I knew you'd betray us all!;;;;;;;;
5880;(Mobile Suit Gundam Seed);Athrun Zala;Kira... fails to see he's being manipulated by the Naturals! Brilliant as he is, he is also naive and good-natured. They're exploiting him, but he's blind to it. That's why I have to go back! I have to reason with him! Kira is still a fellow Coordinator! I'm positive that he'll come around to our way of thinking.;;;;;;;;
5881;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Joey Wheeler;I coulda been a contendah...;;;;;;;;
5882;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Seto Kaiba;Let me get this straight. You're going to defeat me with a creampuff and an elf?;;;;;;;;
5883;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Joey Wheeler;[sounding like Marlon Brando] I'm the Godfather of Games. Capsice?;;;;;;;;
5884;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yami Yugi;Ready or not, Spirit, this is where you take over.;;;;;;;;
5885;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Tea Gardner;No matter how dark things may get, the special bond I share with my friends will always find a way to shine through! I may be scared, but that fear won't keep me from dueling!;;;;;;;;
5886;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yami Yugi;Exodia, OBLITERATE!!!;;;;;;;;
5887;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Joey Wheeler;I found out I hate virtual dogs.;;;;;;;;
5888;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Underwood Weevil;Say good-bye to The Unstoppable Exodia!;;;;;;;;
5889;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Underwood Weevil;I'm gonna take you out in one giant bug blitzkrieg!;;;;;;;;
5890;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yami Yugi;My grandfather's deck has no pathetic cards, Kaiba. But it does contain... the unstoppable Exodia!;;;;;;;;
5891;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Seto Kaiba;*after Joey offers him to duel* No thanks, I think I'll have much more of a challenge playing solitaire.;;;;;;;;
5892;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yami Yugi;You've fought a valiant duel, my friend, and this is the hardest move I've ever had to make. But this ends now!;;;;;;;;
5893;(Yu-Gi-Oh!);Yami Yugi;It's game time!;;;;;;;;
5894;(Saiyuki);Homura;Power rules the Heavens just as Power rules in the Lower world.;;;;;;;;
5895;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Quiet down or I'll shoot you bastards!;;;;;;;;
5896;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Maten Scripture binding force of power where light is darkness and darkness is light I call upon your power to cast my enemy back Into OBLIVION!;;;;;;;;
5897;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Life is basically a fuedal struggle until you die.;;;;;;;;
5898;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;If you meet Budha - kill him, If you meet the father - kill him. Never be captivated by anyone, just live for yourself.;;;;;;;;
5899;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;I dont need to believe in God to believe in myself.;;;;;;;;
5900;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;I don't believe in anyone, nor do I believe in God. I just believe in myself.;;;;;;;;
5901;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;From the time I was born, till the day I die...The only side I am on, is my own.;;;;;;;;
5902;(Saiyuki);Genjo Sanzo;Consume wine, don't let the wine consume you.;;;;;;;;
5903;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;I can't see Kyoko-san...anymore. But she left me something. Her advice, her feelings... and Tohru. They all... all become fertilizer to help me grow.;;;;;;;;
5904;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;But even though she's gone... she's not really gone, right? That the light won't go on in that apartment... is a lie, right?;;;;;;;;
5905;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;Maybe I was lonely. Maybe I've just... always... been lonely.;;;;;;;;
5906;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;Hmm... you can go anywhere you want? Cuz' I'll go... anywhere with you, y'know. (To Kureno);;;;;;;;
5907;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;HANAJIMA, MY SPEAR! GET ME MY SPEAR!;;;;;;;;
5908;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;This may have been a useless time for you... but I really wanted to see you!;;;;;;;;
5909;(Fruits Basket);Arisa Uotani;Is that the kinda attitude you show to someone concerned about you?! What's gonna happen to the person who wants to see ya, huh?!?! Its obvious... Its obvious you wish to see each other... SO COME AND FREAKIN' SEE ME ALREADY!!;;;;;;;;
5910;(Fruits Basket);Saki Hanajima;I...think that my performance today was a success because he played opposite me. Kyo-kun...Thank you. (To Kazuma);;;;;;;;
5911;(Fruits Basket);Saki Hanajima;I do...want to be with you...I want to be with you...! (To Tohru and Arisa);;;;;;;;
5912;(Fruits Basket);Saki Hanajima;...If Tohru-chan were to die, I...I wonder if I'd be able to smile again one year later? Or if I'd wish that I could forget ever having met her. ...Tohru-chan... has tried really hard...;;;;;;;;
5913;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;Please stop adding to my misery. (to Ayame);;;;;;;;
5914;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;It's over between Kana and me. We're not going to get back together. Even if we were together, I would only miss her... (To Shigure and Ayame);;;;;;;;
5915;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;He's just...he's still a child. There are still a lot of things he can't give up. There's no rush. (To Ayame about Yuki);;;;;;;;
5916;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;One more word Shigure and the entire publishing industry will know every embarrassing thing you've done since you were four.;;;;;;;;
5917;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;I started crying. It was the first time in my life that I felt forgiven. Like I was saved. Like the frozen snow that's melted by spring, the tears wouldn't stop.;;;;;;;;
5918;(Fruits Basket);Saki Hanajima;A sixth sense cannot make up for a total lack of common sense.;;;;;;;;
5919;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;It's true, crying unexpectedly does make you feel better. When you're an adult you forget that.;;;;;;;;
5920;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hiro;Go ahead! I'll just turn you into the police for assaulting a minor! (To Kyo);;;;;;;;
5921;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;[thinking] I only take family as patients and I still get worked to death.;;;;;;;;
5922;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hiro;"Since when did the ""Cat"" set the rules for this house? You mean to tell me that you contribute more to this house than anyone else? Do you pay all the bills? I can't stand people who do absolutely nothing but complain all the time! (To Kyo)";;;;;;;;
5923;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;Often times in memory, we have the tendency to overly romanticize the people we care about.;;;;;;;;
5924;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hiro;"So, what are you saying? You mean if your wife wasn't controlling you, you wouldn't be a villain? You mean you've never thought it's just because you're incompetent? And what's that supposed to mean anyway? (To the story, ""Mogeta"")";;;;;;;;
5925;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;It's not the fun and games you think. It's bizarre... sinister... cursed. (speaking of the curse to Tohru);;;;;;;;
5926;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hiro;You're so gullible! Don't you have any standards? So if I told you to spin around, you'd do it? If they told you to jump off a cliff, would you do that, too? I can't stand people who have no individuality!! (To Tohru);;;;;;;;
5927;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;Please... even if I die surrounded by snow that never melts... please let her be happy.;;;;;;;;
5928;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;Waah, Kyo's picking on me! (Repeated line);;;;;;;;
5929;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;I've gained freedom...and yet... it's so lonesome... (after declaring he was leaving Akito's side);;;;;;;;
5930;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Ayame;"Strangely enough, when you get older, the things you didn't understand when you were a child... start to make sense. ""When this happened, I should have done that."" ""When that happened, I should have said this."" Those types of things. You start to understand rather than regret. It may be closer to repentance. So it may be that I do want to repent and erase the ignorant self from my childhood. Maybe that's what they mean when they say adults are selfish.";;;;;;;;
5931;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;"Pain, suffering. It's pointless to just think about those things. The traveler (referring to ""The Most Foolish Traveler"" by Natsuki Takaya) didn't. That may be stupid to some people but that's not stupid to me. Yuki... Kyo... when you close your eyes, what do you think?";;;;;;;;
5932;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;And if when everything ends, nothing is left in my hands...that's alright.;;;;;;;;
5933;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;Your happiness is in a much more vast world. Look for it. Find it. (to Hatsuharu);;;;;;;;
5934;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;(thinking) I want Haru. I want all of him.;;;;;;;;
5935;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;Something this, something that--jeez you're annoying. (to Yuki);;;;;;;;
5936;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;"(to Kagura) Sorry that's your cue to say ""Shigure you perv"" and roll your eyes, slap me, whatever.";;;;;;;;
5937;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;I do intend to pay you for your services.;;;;;;;;
5938;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;"You don't look like you'd be endowned with something so great (To Tohru, referring to ""womans intuition"")";;;;;;;;
5939;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;Another story of Fruits Basket manga has begun. I have something very important to tell everyone. Yuki is actually...A GIRL!;;;;;;;;
5940;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;Eventually, someday, whatever! If it will break, and we'll be free then that's good enough for me! (To Tohru);;;;;;;;
5941;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;So this is how...it feels... (After just being released from the curse);;;;;;;;
5942;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;How long are you gonna sit in front of me sobbing your little eyes out?! It's depressing! (To Tohru);;;;;;;;
5943;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;"We've just witnessed a classic example of what I like to call ""misdirected rage"". Though I believe the technical term is being an ass.";;;;;;;;
5944;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;I don't need someone as unreliable as you for a partner! (To Tohru);;;;;;;;
5945;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;With so much at stake... are you willing to take the one in 10,000 chance?;;;;;;;;
5946;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;A bond may seem like a beautiful thing from the outside...but if those involved see it as a burden, it's nothing but a shackle.;;;;;;;;
5947;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;You're trying to break the curse. Stop it. What are you trying to do? Do you look down on us? Do you pity our wretched state? Don't bother! We never asked for your sympathy! (To Tohru);;;;;;;;
5948;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;People aren't born social. Sure it comes easier to some people... but most people, like you, need to work at it. Some more than others. You're just inexperienced. For example, as a martial artist, you have the strength to break the table with your fist. But you also have the self-control to stop your fist right before it hits the table. You weren't born with that control, were you? You had to refine it. It's the same as interacting with people. But training for that isn't in the mountains - it has to be in town where people live. Mingling with people, hurting them, getting hurt by them. That's how you learn about people and about yourself. If you don't, you'll never care about anyone but yourself. You may be a black belt fighter, but you're still a white belt in dealing with people. For the sake of the girl who will one day tell you she loves you... Don't turn away. Keep training.;;;;;;;;
5949;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;I have nothing but me. I'll give you myself. You can use me however you like for the rest of my life. (To Shigure);;;;;;;;
5950;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;You reject your femininity... yet at the end here you are using it.;;;;;;;;
5951;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;(thinking) Haru understood me. He cared for me. He loved me.;;;;;;;;
5952;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;I do love Akito... I love her then... I still do now.;;;;;;;;
5953;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;(thinking) I can't stand up...on my own. I can't go...any further. Not...all by myself.;;;;;;;;
5954;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;"I yearn for you more than anyone else. I love you Akito... And that is the irrevocable unwavering truth.(shigures answer to akitos question ""do you like me?"" during a child hood flashback)";;;;;;;;
5955;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;The biggest idiot is you! So why don't you go back to school or whatever it is that idiots like you do and don't ever bother me again! You piece of shit! (To Yuki);;;;;;;;
5956;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;I'm ho-ome! Yuki-kun, Tohru-kun, I'm home! Oh, and let's not forget stupid-clumsy-Kyo-kun-who-lost-yet-another-fight!;;;;;;;;
5957;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;I don't need you anymore. I'm tired of you. (To Haru);;;;;;;;
5958;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;Even I... know what it's like to be jealous. (referring to Kureno and Akito's relationship);;;;;;;;
5959;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;You talk big yet you're nothing but Akito's toy! (To Yuki);;;;;;;;
5960;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;I love you!! Even if you go bald or like underage girls, I can handle it! I'm crazy with love!! (Young Kyoko talking to Tohru's father/her husband);;;;;;;;
5961;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;For there to be pain, there has to be kindness. For darkness to stand out, there has to be the sun.;;;;;;;;
5962;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;"Ah, I'm sorry, I guess this is farewell. Let Tohru find happiness. Please by many people let her be loved. If you become perplexed or make errors, in the end have the kind of life that you can have pride in living. The kind where you can say, ""I persevered"". Repeating delightful things and sad things. And in that way keep getting older. I persevered. (Part of Kyoko's last words that were never said)";;;;;;;;
5963;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;If you don't protect that child, I will never forgive you! (referring to Tohru as she was talking to Kyo on the day of the accident);;;;;;;;
5964;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;Hippo.;;;;;;;;
5965;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;(to Kyo) oh, shut up. shut up! shut up! AAHHH!! AAHHH!!;;;;;;;;
5966;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;We're all born with selfish desires so we can relate to those feelings in others. But kindness is created individually by each person... So it's easy to misunderstand when someone is trying to be kind to you... But, Tohru, people's differences are something to celebrate.;;;;;;;;
5967;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;DON'T LEAVE ME!!;;;;;;;;
5968;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;Tohru, you must always be yourself and do things at your own pace. Someday... you'll catch up.;;;;;;;;
5969;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;"Is it okay for me to have my own life now, father, now that I'm not ""special"" anymore?";;;;;;;;
5970;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;It's you that I want. Do you not want me? Don't you want to be together? (to Rin);;;;;;;;
5971;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;I still can't control my wish to see her. I never thought of how important she was to me. (about Rin);;;;;;;;
5972;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;I want to possess her...to make her belong to me, and only me. (about Rin);;;;;;;;
5973;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Sometimes when I'd go to visit her in the hospital...she would purposely avoid me. Then I didn't know what she was thinking about anymore... (to Yuki, about Rin);;;;;;;;
5974;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Don't try to be a hero, stupid cat. (to Kyo);;;;;;;;
5975;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;I'm creating trouble. Can't you see?;;;;;;;;
5976;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;If you don't let me see Rin... I'll kill myself! If I don't kill you, I'll kill myself! (to Akito);;;;;;;;
5977;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;I'll always love you. (To Yuki);;;;;;;;
5978;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;It's Valentine's day, silly! It's the day when lovers are together!;;;;;;;;
5979;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Don't judge me based on the same story and laugh.;;;;;;;;
5980;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;I thought that, if I could shorten the distance between us, and if you would like me back, then the me that ran away - the dirty me - would be washed away. (To Kyo);;;;;;;;
5981;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Shut up. Quit shouting like you're king of the figgin' world. You're making my ears bleed you bastard. Now I've got some common sense for you... If I wore a tie, it wouldn't change who I am. If I had no piercings, it wouldn't mean I'm nice and if my hair wasn't black, it wouldn't stop me from kicking your ass! Who do you think you are anyway? You think you're God huh?! What's the matter?! Run out of things to say? No more advice?! You're not so hot anymore right now are you?! (Black Haru yelling at student council president for shouting at Momiji);;;;;;;;
5982;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;...There's nothing to feel sorry for on my behalf. I've been a very selfish girl. For the first time, I was able to see that. Thank you for worrying about me, mama. (to her mother);;;;;;;;
5983;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;So stupid! Stupid, Stupid! You're so stupid! You want to live your life scared of being ratted out?! Screw that! I'd rather let everyone know everything!! (to Yuki, Tohru, Kyo, and Momiji while destroying a classroom);;;;;;;;
5984;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;I was... relieved. I realized that, compared to the cat, I had it easy. (To kyo);;;;;;;;
5985;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;A mystery... (Haru says this a lot, usually when it's not a mystery at all);;;;;;;;
5986;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;SHII-CHAN, YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!! (after learning that Shigure invited Akito to the summer house);;;;;;;;
5987;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;"Why..? How can she say things like that so easily? If we hear that from our parents, what are we supposed to do? Rin thinks that she's been ""bad"". But who do you think is the one who's being ""bad"" here!?! Having people take their anger out on us, being laughed at, not being taken seriously. We kids get hurt just like you do! Why can't you understand something so simple?! Apologize! APOLOGIZE! APOLOGIZE TO RIN!! [Rin's mom shuts the door] HEY!! I TOLD YOU TO APOLOGIZE!!";;;;;;;;
5988;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;"It's just that I'm fighting the pain of lost love. I guess it's what you'd call a rude awakening... or, maybe... the weight of responsibility? But I'm fine. I'm fine. Caring for someone isn't based on logic. You can't really rationalize emotions. Once I think ""I like him""... it's all over.";;;;;;;;
5989;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;It's amazing no one's locked you up yet (to Shigure);;;;;;;;
5990;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;Kyo-kun! Kyo-kun! I do love you, Kyo-kun! I love you!!!;;;;;;;;
5991;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Oh, you know... I'm gonna do this, and a little of that... and I'm definitely gonna do THAT...! (to Kyo about Tohru, after calling her Kyo's girlfriend);;;;;;;;
5992;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;Starting today... I'll be with you! I'll always be by your side! (to a young Kyo);;;;;;;;
5993;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;You pansy! What kind of girly punch is that? I didn't even feel it! (to Kyo);;;;;;;;
5994;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;Especially Yuki... He was my first love after all... [Tohru stops walking];;;;;;;;
5995;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;You sicko...I knew you were depraved, but I never imagined how low you could sink! (to shigure);;;;;;;;
5996;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Kagura... Regardless of what your reason was, when you played with me...I was happy. Thanks. (To Kagura);;;;;;;;
5997;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;[To Tohru] Ever since you left I've been getting pissed off about everything, and because I couldn't understand why, it just pissed me off even more!;;;;;;;;
5998;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Yo...time to pay the piper rat boy...I'm here to collect;;;;;;;;
5999;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Tohru, I can't stand not being with you... I... because I love you.;;;;;;;;
6000;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;I love you. When did I start to love you so much?;;;;;;;;
6001;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;[to Kyo after they trip] What can I learn from a stupid cat like you? You didn't even know that Jason isn't really a bear! He's a character from a horror film!;;;;;;;;
6002;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;"...As they played the game...I waited for someone to call ""onigiri"". But no one called. I was very little then. I had almost forgotten about that. But they knew...there would never be room for an onigiri...in a fruits basket.";;;;;;;;
6003;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;[To Yuki] Liar! Moping around like a sad rat who lost his cheese!;;;;;;;;
6004;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;STOP IMAGINING ME!;;;;;;;;
6005;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[To Kyo] Being away from everyone else may be lonely, but being away from you will be even lonelier.;;;;;;;;
6006;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;[referring to Tohru] If anyone can find a way to choke on rice, it's her.;;;;;;;;
6007;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;Don't you ever talk about Miss Honda that way again, you low life.;;;;;;;;
6008;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;It's not always easy to see the good in people. In some people, you might even doubt that it's there at all. But if you can somehow, find a way to believe...sometimes that's all it takes to help someone, to give them the strength to find the good in themselves.;;;;;;;;
6009;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Be selfish, say what you want once in a while. It's okay to let yourself be sad.;;;;;;;;
6010;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;My mom told me, it's better to trust people than to doubt them. She said that people aren't born with kind hearts. When we're born, all we have are desires for food and material things. Selfish instincts, I guess. But she said that kindness is something that grows inside of each person's body, but it's up to us to nurture that kindness in our hearts. That's why kindness is different for every person.;;;;;;;;
6011;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;Mom taught me that people's differences are something to celebrate. When I thought of all the different shapes of human kindness -- imagining them as round or square...I got really excited. Your kindness is like a candle Sohma-kun. I can feel it light up, and I just want to smile. It's that kind of kindness.;;;;;;;;
6012;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Maybe I'm not perfect. Maybe I have a long way to go. But someday... someday I'll be able to stand and walk on my own. Without hurting anyone... and without being a burden. (to Kazuma);;;;;;;;
6013;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;A woman who can talk tough while completely naked...amazing. (about Rin, the horse);;;;;;;;
6014;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[After seeing Yuki, Shigure, and Kyo Sohma transform for the first time] THEY'RE ALL ANIMALS!;;;;;;;;
6015;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;I don't want to be anyone's burden. I don't want you to be my dad if it's going to hurt you. (thinking about Kazuma);;;;;;;;
6016;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;[To Kyo] Perhaps if you'd just die you'd be reincarnated as something more pleasant.;;;;;;;;
6017;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[On first seeing Kyo] The ceiling... Is he hurt...? Wh-who... Well, hello, orange-head...;;;;;;;;
6018;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;ou know you're a real wise ass, you know that?! (to Yuki);;;;;;;;
6019;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;Leave her out of this... who we let in this house is really none of your concern. You're the one who doesn't belong here. (to Kyo);;;;;;;;
6020;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;"It's a mystery. Just because of a simple sentence... I get shaken... or I get happy. Kyo-kun is mysterious indeed. (After Kyo says, ""You wanna kill some time... with me?"")";;;;;;;;
6021;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;I'm gonna take my place as a true member of this family!;;;;;;;;
6022;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Ha ha! Eat my dust, rat-boy! (to Yuki);;;;;;;;
6023;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;I never... [chuckles]... laughed this hard in front of my parents.(to Tohru);;;;;;;;
6024;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;As long as you live things will keep happening! As long as you're alive wishes will keep being made!;;;;;;;;
6025;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;You know... you really are something... (to Tohru);;;;;;;;
6026;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;Skin him. Now. Barbeque the bastard!! (referring to Ayame);;;;;;;;
6027;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[To Ritsu Sohma] Sometimes living can be hard, but it's only because we're alive that we can make each other laugh, cry...be happy! [thinking] If that's not the reason for being born in this world...I don't know what is!;;;;;;;;
6028;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Yo... Are you ready for me to break your neck... Rat-boy?;;;;;;;;
6029;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;"(referring to the letter for Kisa from the teacher) Here. It says to ""like yourself"". But good things about yourself... how are you supposed to find them? I only know things I hate about myself. 'Cause that's all I know, I hate myself. But even if you force yourself to find good things... it feels so empty. It doesn't work that way. People like your teacher just don't get it. I think... when you hear someone say they like you, for the first time... then you can begin to like yourself. I think when someone accepts you, for the first time... you feel like you can... forgive yourself a little. You can begin to face your fears... with courage.";;;;;;;;
6030;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[in her head] My happiness comes from the kindness of those around me.;;;;;;;;
6031;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;[To Kyo] Seriously... Must you break something every time you come home? When are you going to learn? You're too weak.;;;;;;;;
6032;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[To Ritsu Sohma] I'm sure that inside your heart...you're trying with all your might to find it on your own...the reason you were born. Because...because really...there might not be anyone who was born with a reason. I think that everyone might have to find one on their own. [in her head] A reason for being born... A reason that it's okay to be alive... A reason to exist. [aloud] I think everyone might have to find it themselves...and decide for themselves. It could be your dreams...your job...or a person. ...The reason you're looking for...might be vague, unclear...and uncertain. [in her head] And you might lose it. [aloud] But as long as you're alive...you have to keep searching for that reason.;;;;;;;;
6033;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;"[To Kyo Sohma]If you think of someone's good qualities as the umeboshi in an onigiri, it's as if their qualities are stuck to their back! People around the world are like onigiri. Everyone has an umeboshi with a different shape and color and flavor. But because it's stuck on their back, they might not be able to see their umeboshi. ""There's nothing special about me. I'm just white rice."" [in her head] That's not true. There is an umeboshi -- on your back. [aloud] Maybe the reason people get jealous of each other, is because they can see so clearly the umeboshi on other people's backs. I can see them, too. I can see them perfectly. There's an amazing umeboshi on your back, Kyo-kun.";;;;;;;;
6034;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hiro;I want to be the only one... who can help the one I care about.;;;;;;;;
6035;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatori;Someday... no matter how cold it is now... the snow will melt. Without fail.;;;;;;;;
6036;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Ayame;NOW, SPARKLE, MY HOUSE OF LEARNING!!;;;;;;;;
6037;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Momiji;But I think... I want to live with all my memories. Even if they're bad memories. Even if they're memories that only hurt me... that I'd rather forget. If I keep them and keep trying, without running away, then someday I'll be strong enough that those memories can't defeat me. I believe that because I want to think that there's no such thing as a memory that's ok to forget.;;;;;;;;
6038;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Shigure;Sometimes I think the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house.;;;;;;;;
6039;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Rin;Why don't you stop forcing yourself on him and calling it love? It's painful to watch (to Kagura about Kyo);;;;;;;;
6040;(Fruits Basket);Akito Sohma;Idiots should do what idiots can to be quicker.;;;;;;;;
6041;(Fruits Basket);Kyoko Honda;True kindness isn't something we're born with. It's something we had to work on... (to Tohru);;;;;;;;
6042;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kagura;I just told you what I think, now say something DAMMIT!;;;;;;;;
6043;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Hatsuharu;You make me sick, you and your pathetic girly whining... You're not a MAN! You're just a little kitty-cat who's afraid to fight! Know what?! YOU CAN GO TO HELL! HAHAHAHAHA! UGH! (gets kicked by Kyo in the face);;;;;;;;
6044;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Kyo;Stupid ocean!!! Ya want me to kill you? Huh??;;;;;;;;
6045;(Fruits Basket);Sohma Yuki;I won't ask what you wish for. I only hope it comes true by your own two hands. (to Kyo);;;;;;;;
6046;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;[After Hatori asks what snow becomes when it melts]Ah...um, well...hmm. It becomes spring! No matter how cold it is now, spring will come again! Without fail. It's strange isn't it? But it's true.;;;;;;;;
6047;(Fruits Basket);Honda Tohru;A lot of people are too scared to admit that they're still children. They do everything they can to avoid it. So people who can admit that have a lot of courage.;;;;;;;;
6048;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;You must believe in yourself, follow your path without fear.;;;;;;;;
6049;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;A poor choice seals our fate.;;;;;;;;
6050;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;I'll help you... But not by death, this world has enough of that. You can keep your life as long as you change the way you live it. It's never too late, believe me.;;;;;;;;
6051;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Does he really believe we would turn around after all that we've been through?;;;;;;;;
6052;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Underestimating an opponent is the first step towards defeat.;;;;;;;;
6053;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;We've gone far past the stage of fighting for our honor.;;;;;;;;
6054;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;You do them one favor and they think you're their best friend. This is why I could care less if their entire species was swallowed up.;;;;;;;;
6055;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;You try to sound like you think things through, when in fact, you're not thinking at all.;;;;;;;;
6056;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;I've been under too much stress lately. Killing you should be a good remedy.;;;;;;;;
6057;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;I'm not a fighter of good. I just hate people who are bad.;;;;;;;;
6058;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Being lucky seems to be your greatest tactic.;;;;;;;;
6059;(D.N.Angel);Risa Harada;I can't lose to my older sister! Right now she's ahead of me by 2 millimeters in chest size!;;;;;;;;
6060;(D.N.Angel);Risa Harada;*to Riku* At least I'm the cute one!!;;;;;;;;
6061;(D.N.Angel);Riku Harada;Mom, dad, Risa became a delinquent!;;;;;;;;
6062;(D.N.Angel);Riku Harada;He wouldn't notice if I got a crew cut, shaved my head bald, or even grew an afro!;;;;;;;;
6063;(D.N.Angel);Argentine;You'll break. Humans are so fragile.;;;;;;;;
6064;(D.N.Angel);Argentine;Are you, what they call, a heart?;;;;;;;;
6065;(D.N.Angel);Argentine;He told me...that which is incomplete seeks completion... yet...that which is incomplete is no better than that which is complete. Do you understand?;;;;;;;;
6066;(D.N.Angel);Masahiro;I'm scared to go over there!;;;;;;;;
6067;(D.N.Angel);Masahiro;His stupidity is 50% above normal levels.;;;;;;;;
6068;(D.N.Angel);Krad;My name is Krad. But you do not have to remember it, because here you will die.;;;;;;;;
6069;(D.N.Angel);Krad;Risa is a bitch.;;;;;;;;
6070;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;Yuusuke... Dammit Yuusuke, listen to me! Everyone has to fight with time to find their place before their inevitable death. Toguro... he ran away from that fight. Don't you ever do the same. No human is ever a one man show. Every decision that you make will affect the countless people who care about you. Do you understand? You can't be a cocky kid anymore.;;;;;;;;
6071;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;Thanks for the real vote of confidence. You two should be cheerleaders, you'd look cute in skirts!;;;;;;;;
6072;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;You've trapped yourself in a body you hated hiding in the pain, and now you want to torture yourself again for eternity...haven't we both paid enough?;;;;;;;;
6073;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;I fight to get what I need, and I kill whoever gets in my way. I always have.;;;;;;;;
6074;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;Oh, silly me. I must have forgotten to turn on my hearing aid. When you're a washed up old hag like me, the memory is the first to go.;;;;;;;;
6075;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;What a silly little girl I was, thinking you would change. I should have known how you would turn out. You had it written in ugly black letters all across your soul.;;;;;;;;
6076;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;I know you play by higher standards, but at least give me credit for the nose.;;;;;;;;
6077;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;Don't make me slap you upside the head, just shoot the damn thing!;;;;;;;;
6078;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Genkai;Use the Spirit Wave to float on top of the spike. Good. Now we'll hold this for twelve hours.;;;;;;;;
6079;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;(To Sensui) Here's a one way ticket straight to Hell! YOU BASTAARD!;;;;;;;;
6080;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Obviously you are underestimating Kurama. Do you know why I chose him to be my partner? To avoid fighting him myself. Watch, he's more cut-throat then I am when it comes to battle, and unbelievably precise.;;;;;;;;
6081;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;My arm did not obey a certain command I gave it, so I decided it needed to be punished.;;;;;;;;
6082;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;I'm warning you. You so much as bruise what you hold in your hand and I will show you pain. The hue of your soul will cease to matter, because you will not be judged when you die, you will no longer to exist.;;;;;;;;
6083;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;What repulsive creature makes my eardrums bleed?;;;;;;;;
6084;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Nerd violence...;;;;;;;;
6085;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Even as a child, I found tremendous pleasure in spilling my enemy's blood. Their screams of agony were my music. Once I learned that my mother's frozen tear drop was valuable, I began wearing in open sight of everyone, hoping their greed would entice them to challenge me, thus giving me the opportunity for my next kill.;;;;;;;;
6086;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Agh, it penetrates my brain!;;;;;;;;
6087;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Do I have to kill you to stop you from being foolish?;;;;;;;;
6088;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;What irony. Such beauty, sprung from such an ugly soil.;;;;;;;;
6089;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;This is the second time today I hold your life in my hands. I somehow doubt that Sensui will be more merciful than I am.;;;;;;;;
6090;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Logic is panic's prey.;;;;;;;;
6091;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;This is pure offense. They gave up fighting with their brains a long time ago.;;;;;;;;
6092;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Tired hands are better than none.;;;;;;;;
6093;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;I know as much of games as I do of hugs and puppies, and care for them even less. Wake me for the end of the world.;;;;;;;;
6094;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;I think Monster Beast Doughnut is a perfect name.;;;;;;;;
6095;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Kurama, do not make me come over there and remove that precious thing you call a voice box.;;;;;;;;
6096;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;You should know better than to corner an animal like a fox... We have a tendency to show our teeth.;;;;;;;;
6097;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Don't worry fool, we've entered into an alliance and I'm not the type to break it. Of course, after we win the tournament I can't guarantee anything.;;;;;;;;
6098;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;I thought clowns made everyone else laugh.;;;;;;;;
6099;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Kurama, there is no person who does not carry scars upon their heart, and if there were such a man, they would be a shallow soul.;;;;;;;;
6100;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;All the while we've been thinking you were a brilliant strategist when really, you're just a lucky fool.;;;;;;;;
6101;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;He's swinging his sword with the grace of a flyswatter. That's no way to survive.;;;;;;;;
6102;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Regret is a different beast when you live for centuries.;;;;;;;;
6103;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;Tell me, how does it feel to live in a constant haze of stupidity?;;;;;;;;
6104;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Sorry, I don't have time to be arrested.;;;;;;;;
6105;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Hiei;You're a team player, a save-the-day superhero... I hate people like you.;;;;;;;;
6106;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Any prize worth having requires a risk.;;;;;;;;
6107;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kurama;Rely on impulse and not even your thoughts can betray you.;;;;;;;;
6108;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;What are you waiting for, your balls to drop?;;;;;;;;
6109;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;*to Urameshi* Sacrificing your life to save billions of others. You've lit our torches and I won't let your death be in vain... even if it means I'll be joining you soon.;;;;;;;;
6110;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Please no eat me, please no eat, no!;;;;;;;;
6111;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;First you say I'm faster then you get the heads up on me like I'm an old lady crossing the freeway! Just once I'd like some honesty from the bad guys!;;;;;;;;
6112;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Bite my ankles shorty, I swear I'll make you cry to your mom! If you have a mom, that is!;;;;;;;;
6113;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I'm not into this kinky stuff, and you're WAY too old!;;;;;;;;
6114;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Of all the nerve, assault me and then ask for a meal, you're getting squat!;;;;;;;;
6115;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;So maybe I can't defend against attacks from multiple angles, but sometimes a good defense is just kicking ass!;;;;;;;;
6116;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;How about I gently shove my foot down your throat?;;;;;;;;
6117;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;You can't end a good party without someone on the floor.;;;;;;;;
6118;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Stop laughing hamster legs!;;;;;;;;
6119;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Alright already, you had me at shut up.;;;;;;;;
6120;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;It smells girly. I don't think I like it.;;;;;;;;
6121;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;I don't care if it's a girl, a baby or someone's grandma. I'm gonna fight her anyway.;;;;;;;;
6122;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Maybe there've been times when I've been pissed and hated things, but it wasn't from this work. My dad's a no-show, my mom's lush and school sucks, but this job is the one damn thing I'm good at. If all the crap in my life hasn't screwed up yet, then neither will this and neither will you.;;;;;;;;
6123;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Aw, man. You're such a friggin' disgrace. I can't believe I spent so much time trying to defeat such a coward. Now get up and fight!;;;;;;;;
6124;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;What the hell was that? All my punches were solid, but he brushed them aside like broccoli he didn't order! Didn't even give me a chance to kick his ass!;;;;;;;;
6125;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Ugly?! Who you callin' ugly?! C'mere you mouse!;;;;;;;;
6126;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Fine! You heard fox boy, there's nothing we can do for the old hag if she's already limp. Just gotta keep on truckin, yes sir! I'm gonna go outside and make myself a nice, big, shiny first-place medal, sit in the sun, and have a stupendous friggin day, dammit!;;;;;;;;
6127;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;You took my teacher, and now I let you take my friend. What the hell do you want from me?;;;;;;;;
6128;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Why does everything you say makes me wanna bash your face in?;;;;;;;;
6129;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Damn, at least one of us should've died!;;;;;;;;
6130;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;That rose whip of his must be ten feet long. Where does he stash it? All the ways I can think of sound kinda painful.;;;;;;;;
6131;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Kurama really is a fox thing, and to think I let him near my kitten!;;;;;;;;
6132;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Ugly people shouldn't be allowed to smile that much!;;;;;;;;
6133;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;This is DUUUMMMBBB!!!!!!;;;;;;;;
6134;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;Hey! Shorty's a lot cooler than I thought.;;;;;;;;
6135;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;Yusuke Urameshi, age 14. Survived by his mom and everybody. After going through a big ordeal to get his life back, Yusuke had a brief second chance until he was eaten by a fish! That's right! No heroic death! No fighting evil villans! Fish food!;;;;;;;;
6136;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;We all have to die when our time comes, but if we do our duty we don't got regrets. So taste a little piece of my sword, Toguro!;;;;;;;;
6137;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;You know, it'd really be embarrassing to get eaten by something that came out of an egg this tiny.;;;;;;;;
6138;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;That's it! My head as a trampoline is where I draw the line!;;;;;;;;
6139;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Kazuma Kuwabara;You know, I really can't stand it when guys pick on people weaker than them...but I guess I'll do it to you anyway!;;;;;;;;
6140;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;So sorry you caught me on such a bad day, it makes me a real jerk!;;;;;;;;
6141;(Yu Yu Hakusho);Yuusuke Urameshi;You shouldn't talk. It makes you sound stupid.;;;;;;;;
6142;(Pokémon);Silver;Huh? What are you doing falling into a hole? Some genius you are. Serves you right!;;;;;;;;
6143;(Pokémon);Kojirou;(singing) A tisket, a tasket, a pokemon egg basket!;;;;;;;;
6144;(Pokémon);Rocket Grunt;Stop meddling in Team Rocket's affairs!;;;;;;;;
6145;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Well, I like to look at myself in my spare time.;;;;;;;;
6146;(Pokémon);Kojirou;I thought I just heard someone say 'We're blasting off again' but we copyrighted that!;;;;;;;;
6147;(Pokémon);Kojirou;I have no idea what just happened, but I'll gladly take credit for it.;;;;;;;;
6148;(Pokémon);Rocket Grunt;Okay, I'll talk! Take the elevator to see my boss!;;;;;;;;
6149;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Fruit doesn't grow on trees, you know!;;;;;;;;
6150;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Being good guys for once would be super-dupulous!;;;;;;;;
6151;(Pokémon);Kojirou;When it comes to catching Spinda, we sure are the Winda!;;;;;;;;
6152;(Pokémon);Rocket Grunt;We're pulling a big job here! Get lost, kid!;;;;;;;;
6153;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Quick! It's coming! Dance like an eggplant!;;;;;;;;
6154;(Pokémon);Kojirou;(using a rental Pikachu doll) Thundershock, Thunderbolt, Thunder. I've been defeated so many times by Pikachu's attacks, I know them all by heart! Ahahahahahaha!;;;;;;;;
6155;(Pokémon);Kojirou;We have a proud tradition of failure to uphold!;;;;;;;;
6156;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Steal one, get one free!;;;;;;;;
6157;(Pokémon);Kojirou;This steak is too well done. Take it back and make it rare.;;;;;;;;
6158;(Pokémon);Rocket Grunt;How can you not see the beauty of our evil?!;;;;;;;;
6159;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Team Rocket may be dirty rotten criminals, but we're not in the business of destroying children's dreams! At least, not yet.;;;;;;;;
6160;(Pokémon);Kojirou;With enemies like that, who needs friends?;;;;;;;;
6161;(Pokémon);Rocket Grunt;Don't touch the poster at the Game Corner! There's no secret switch behind it!;;;;;;;;
6162;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Like, wow, don't I make like the COOLEST girl?;;;;;;;;
6163;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Drat, we wasted this episode cheering the good guys!;;;;;;;;
6164;(Pokémon);Kojirou;Time for action, Weezing!;;;;;;;;
6165;(Pokémon);Green;I'd better split before I catch loser-itis!;;;;;;;;
6166;(Pokémon);Blue;You stinker! I took it easy on you!;;;;;;;;
6167;(Pokémon);Blue;What?! Unbelievable! I picked the wrong Pokémon!;;;;;;;;
6168;(Pokémon);Blue;Smell ya later.;;;;;;;;
6169;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;There's no sense in going out of your way just to get somebody to like you.;;;;;;;;
6170;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Whoever smelt it dealt it!;;;;;;;;
6171;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;The chosen one? I feel more like the frozen one.;;;;;;;;
6172;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;She is trying to use rep... per... pre... what is it again? Oh, yeah! Perverse Psychology on me!;;;;;;;;
6173;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Right now, I kinda wish that my mom named me Bob instead of Ash.;;;;;;;;
6174;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;I'm an apple for a day and I need a doctor right away...;;;;;;;;
6175;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;And I thought you were going to buy a stone to evolve yourself.;;;;;;;;
6176;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;You look like a guy anyway!;;;;;;;;
6177;(Pokémon);Hikari;Everyone makes mistakes the first time around.;;;;;;;;
6178;(Pokémon);Hikari;A left... and then a right. Or is it a right and then a left? Hmm... maybe the postcard's upside-down.;;;;;;;;
6179;(Pokémon);Hikari;Oh, no! Wrong way! I want my mom!;;;;;;;;
6180;(Pokémon);Haruka;And I'll be happy to vouch for his insanity!;;;;;;;;
6181;(Pokémon);Haruka;I think Romeo likes Juliet!;;;;;;;;
6182;(Pokémon);Haruka;(after Pikachu accidentally zaps her bike to a crisp) My bike's been barbecued!!;;;;;;;;
6183;(Pokémon);Haruka;But just between you and I, what I'm more interested in is traveling and seeing new places. (screams as she goes down a hill after being scared by a Duskull) I guess I... shoulda worn a... (crashes into a tree) helmet.;;;;;;;;
6184;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Ahh, don't get your underwear in a knot.;;;;;;;;
6185;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;For a second there I thought the floor was going to--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! Where'd the ground go?;;;;;;;;
6186;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Mom, you're embarrassing me! In front of all these people? Don't you know I'm a big kid now?;;;;;;;;
6187;(Pokémon);Kasumi;Pikachu, you're a Pika-pal!;;;;;;;;
6188;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;If anybody's out there, you can come out. And if you're a monster or a ghost, you can stay where you are, and we won't bother you.;;;;;;;;
6189;(Pokémon);Kasumi;It's my own recipe which I call Misty's mystery stew, and it's got 47 secret ingredients.;;;;;;;;
6190;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Let's eat fast so we can eat again!;;;;;;;;
6191;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Hahahahahahahah! Now we'll see who has the last quack!;;;;;;;;
6192;(Pokémon);Kasumi;Very funny. Carrots, peppers, and bugs! Everyone has something they don't like and I don't like bugs!;;;;;;;;
6193;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Treecko! Use your Tail Slap attack!;;;;;;;;
6194;(Pokémon);Kasumi;Ash will never really be alone cause he's got... me.;;;;;;;;
6195;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Eat righteous Ponyta dust!;;;;;;;;
6196;(Pokémon);Kasumi;If I want your opinion I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU!!!;;;;;;;;
6197;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;Uh, my name... is... Ketchup! No, wait! My name is really Tom Ato!;;;;;;;;
6198;(Pokémon);Kasumi;Isn't that color a little bright for a ninja?;;;;;;;;
6199;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;I'm having a major hat crisis. Could you try to steal Pikachu some other time?;;;;;;;;
6200;(Pokémon);Kasumi;Love is all about who lands the first punch!;;;;;;;;
6201;(Pokémon);Kasumi;We'd love to get up, Ash...unfortunately, you're STANDING on us.;;;;;;;;
6202;(Pokémon);Pikachu;PIKA-CHU-UUUUUUU!;;;;;;;;
6203;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;I have my own method of bending spoons. (bends the spoon with his hands) Ha! Muscle over mind!;;;;;;;;
6204;(Pokémon);Ash Ketchum;It was an egg-cident! Get it? 'Egg?;;;;;;;;
6205;(Pokémon);Pikachu;Pika Pika!;;;;;;;;
6206;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Yuri Shibuya;How is this possible? I must be the first person in history who was flushed down the toilet!;;;;;;;;
6207;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Yuri Shibuya;This has got to be a joke! I'm being sucked into a black hole inside a toilet! Either that or there's one gigantic vacuum cleaner down here.;;;;;;;;
6208;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Murata Ken;The past is the past. We cannot indulge ourselves in memories and destroy the present.;;;;;;;;
6209;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;If... If you have such good deductive skills, you should have been able to see through my sister's disguise easily... But... but... WHY...!!!;;;;;;;;
6210;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;Idiot... There's no win or lose in this, no higher or lower... There is always...only ONE truth.;;;;;;;;
6211;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;This is my case! I'm going to solve it!! Don't get involved!;;;;;;;;
6212;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;If you stay hidden like this, you'll be able to get away from the police, however, you will never escape your crime... Madam, are you trying... Are you trying to force your son to carry this burden for the rest of his life?;;;;;;;;
6213;(Detective Conan);Ran Mouri;You're always away during the important times and all you do is call. There are times when you are finally here, but then you disappear unexpectedly. Every time... every time... always, always, leaving me behind alone. What do you think I am? I love you Shinichi!;;;;;;;;
6214;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;She should want to see me. If I had said how I feel about her, she would miss me even more. All this time, I've been breaking her heart by keeping her wait, yet I can't still appear before her eyes. I never want to see her cry anymore. Even if it means I no longer exist in her heart. How immature of me, right?;;;;;;;;
6215;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;The only ones that can miss a kick draw match are those who have enough courage to kick it.;;;;;;;;
6216;(Detective Conan);Ai Haibara;Flowers are fragile and ephemeral... Even if you meant to protect them with a surrounding fence from wind and rain, they would die without sunlight...and a spindly fence has no power against a strong wind. Are you fully aware of that, Kudo-kun?..;;;;;;;;
6217;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;Even if you are facing a bitter aspect of life... Drugs and murder are foul, without any excuse. Deserve a red card, for a loser.;;;;;;;;
6218;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;There is only one truth.;;;;;;;;
6219;(Detective Conan);Ran Mouri;Courage is a word that gives you the strength to do what's right, you should not use it as an excuse to murder someone.;;;;;;;;
6220;(Detective Conan);Ran Mouri;People can really change. When they're far away from each other, their hearts will change. It's so cruel that the only thing I can do is wait.;;;;;;;;
6221;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;Is a reason nesessary? I don't know why you would kill someone. But as for saving someone... A logical mind isn't needed, right?;;;;;;;;
6222;(Bleach);Kariya Jin;I am sane. It's this world that's crazy.;;;;;;;;
6223;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;I don't give a rat's ass about going to hell. I guess it's because I feel like I'm already there.;;;;;;;;
6224;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;Don't live your life making up excuses. The one making your choices is yourself!;;;;;;;;
6225;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;If you're gonna send people after me, bring on the strongest you have.;;;;;;;;
6226;(Samurai Champloo);Jin;*to Mugen* Do you want to go through all the trouble of causing an uproar to expose the level of your idiocy? Try to moderate your self-importance.;;;;;;;;
6227;(Samurai Champloo);Kasumi Fuu;"They say ""there's always room for dessert"", but for me, it's more like ""there's always room if someone else is paying"".";;;;;;;;
6228;(Samurai Champloo);Jin;I have no desire to kill you. In fact, you're not worth killing. Killing you, would only tarnish my blade.;;;;;;;;
6229;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;When you point a sword at someone, either you kill them or they kill you, there ain't no in between. So quit talkin' like a fuckin' pussy. Anyone who can't handle that should just SHUT THE FUCK UP and GET OVER IT!;;;;;;;;
6230;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;[after drawing the infinity symbol] I thought of it myself, it stands for... Mugen.;;;;;;;;
6231;(Samurai Champloo);Jin;I think I've found what I was looking for all this time. I, who was always alone... found comrades for the first time.;;;;;;;;
6232;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;I think that every day the sun rises, it may be the last time I bask in the sun.;;;;;;;;
6233;(Samurai Champloo);Kasumi Fuu;This world would be in darkness without a sense of duty.;;;;;;;;
6234;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;If we were all the way up there, no one here'd look any bigger than a grain of sand.;;;;;;;;
6235;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;[in front of an execution squad] I don't give a rat's ass about going to hell. Guess I feel like I'm already there. What I do mind is the thought of being killed by you ugly bastards. I've gone my whole life without being helped by anyone else, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you help me into my grave.;;;;;;;;
6236;(Samurai Champloo);Kasumi Fuu;There's always room for free food.;;;;;;;;
6237;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;[looking at a porno magazine] Geez, doing it with a squid.;;;;;;;;
6238;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;[Fuu passed out after one drink and is asleep] Sleeping so carelessly. I could do something to you so easily.;;;;;;;;
6239;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;Kiss my ass.;;;;;;;;
6240;(Samurai Champloo);Jin;Cutting down a man who's done nothing wrong. Is that what you spent all that time honing those skills for? In my opinion, you're worthless.;;;;;;;;
6241;(Samurai Champloo);Mugen;Forget all that formal crap 'bout comin' at me one at a time. I'll take all you bitches on!;;;;;;;;
6242;(Fate/stay night);Lancer;#NAVN?;;;;;;;;
6243;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Atone for my sins? [...] I have no sins to atone for, nor have I forced such a meaningless concept on anyone.;;;;;;;;
6244;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Kiritsugu;Saving someone means not saving someone else.;;;;;;;;
6245;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;...She's scary. People who can put on a serious face while joking are the scariest.;;;;;;;;
6246;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;I'm home. What, are you greeting me in an apron? You look pretty good in it.;;;;;;;;
6247;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Oh, immortality. Heh, I gave that to the snake.;;;;;;;;
6248;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Fortunately, I do not have any pride. But what about it? Will the name of the hero be disgraced? Hah, don't make me laugh, Lancer. You can wash away disgrace with results. You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs.;;;;;;;;
6249;(Fate/stay night);Archer;You are a hateful woman. You oppose me to the very end. But I shall forgive you.;;;;;;;;
6250;(Fate/stay night);Archer;"Yes, the seats are limited. There are always fewer seats called ""happiness"" than there are people to fill them.";;;;;;;;
6251;(Fate/stay night);Saber;...a man without fear cannot be wise.;;;;;;;;
6252;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;But that's enough. If there is overwhelming power and speed, there is no room for technique. Techniques are something humans invented to compensate for their weaknesses.;;;;;;;;
6253;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;...Yes, the desire to protect something... is, at the same time, none other than the wish for something to violate it.;;;;;;;;
6254;(Fate/stay night);Kotomine Kirei;It is the path you have chosen. Take pride in it.;;;;;;;;
6255;(Fate/stay night);Tohsaka Rin;The world is just another word for the things you value around you, right? That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.;;;;;;;;
6256;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;My goal is so far away that I'm not even on the starting line yet.;;;;;;;;
6257;(Fate/stay night);Lancer;Heroes always die due to unreasonable orders.;;;;;;;;
6258;(Fate/stay night);Archer;That's right! I admired his desire to save people because it was beautiful! But none of that feeling is my own! What else can you call it but hypocrisy?! I was driven by my obsessive need to help someone. I kept running, neither noticing the pain nor how wrong I was! But it's all a fake. Such hypocrisy can not save anything. No, first of all, I didn't even know what I wanted to save!;;;;;;;;
6259;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Defying me till the very end, huh? But I'll forgive you. Some things are beautiful exactly because they are unobtainable.;;;;;;;;
6260;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;The weakness that had accepted death now became the strength of wanting to live.;;;;;;;;
6261;(Fate/stay night);Archer;I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body, and fire is my blood. I have created over a thousand blades. Unknown to death. Nor known to life. Have withstood pain to create many weapons. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray,;;;;;;;;
"'Unlimited Blade Works'""";;;;;;;;;;;
6262;(Fate/stay night);Archer;The things we can't obtain are the most beautiful ones.;;;;;;;;
6263;(Fate/stay night);Saber;Hunger is the enemy.;;;;;;;;
6264;(Fate/stay night);Gilgamesh;A lot of something is ugly in itself.;;;;;;;;
6265;(Fate/stay night);Archer;Yes, I saw it over and over... Meaningless massacres. Meaningless suffering. Meaningless happiness! I was forced to watch it all. Even when I refused to look, it surrounded me. That isn't what I wished for! I didn't become a Guardian for this!;;;;;;;;
6266;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;People die when they are killed.;;;;;;;;
6267;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;Do you have enough swords, King of Heroes?;;;;;;;;
6268;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;It feels so close to me, yet I can't reach it even if I hold out my hands. But even if I can't reach it, there are things that will stay in my heart. Being in the same time and looking at the same sky – if I can remember that, then even if we are far apart, I believe we can still be together.;;;;;;;;
6269;(Fate/stay night);Emiya Shirou;Someday, my memories of her will fade. Her voice, her actions – I might forget them as well. But even then, I will always remember that I loved her.;;;;;;;;
6270;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;You suddenly appeared in front of me in this hell. The day that I would get to meet you...I always wanted to apologize to you...I only endured because of that! I kept on living.;;;;;;;;
6271;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;I hate these horns.;;;;;;;;
6272;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;When you are miserable, you need something that is even more miserable than you to feel good about yourself.;;;;;;;;
6273;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;I was going to let you go. After all, there aren't many of us out there, but you're just such a pain in the ass.;;;;;;;;
6274;(Elfen Lied);Lucy;Everyone in this place is unhappy. And since they're unhappy, they're probably looking for someone worse off than they are.;;;;;;;;
6275;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;I was afraid of the me that didn't know what he wanted to do. And the days just keep on moving. But even then If I keep on going like this, will I be able to see it? Maybe someday.;;;;;;;;
6276;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;To have the one you think is your ideal self standing in front of you, it's tough...;;;;;;;;
6277;(Honey and Clover);Takumi Nomiya;A guy who likes someone else shouldn't be taking care of the girl he just dumped.;;;;;;;;
6278;(Honey and Clover);Takumi Nomiya;Mayama, if you can't be with her on every festival, then you have no right to say anything.;;;;;;;;
6279;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;I put my hopes in it that maybe I could turn your heart just a little. Why do I end up dreaming over and over again without getting tired of it as if that's all I know.;;;;;;;;
6280;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;When we were together, my heart felt tight, too tight to even drink water. If that's called love, then it was really just me who was in love. Just me.;;;;;;;;
6281;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;A day when everything is perfect, when everything will turn into memories, will eventually come.  But I'll probably remember over and over again you were there and everyone else was there. The day we all searched for just one thing.;;;;;;;;
6282;(Honey and Clover);Rika Harada;I pushed him away and hurt him yet he still stood by my side.  It's not a sane relationship. To be saved by seeing his hurt expression.;;;;;;;;
6283;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;There's no way I'm dying before you do, you morally bankrupt Colonel with a God complex.;;;;;;;;
6284;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;[telling Mustang about the investigation on Scar] His bloodstained clothes washed up further downstream. We don't know if that means that he's dead, or just naked.;;;;;;;;
6285;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;We will take revenge on your behalf.;;;;;;;;
6286;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;I shall cleanse away thy bitterness...;;;;;;;;
6287;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;You are coming with me, we are going to hell.;;;;;;;;
6288;(Jigoku Shoujo);Ai Enma;Pitiful shadow cloaked in darkness. Thy action cause men pain and suffering. Thy hollow soul drowns in thy sins. How would you like to see what death is like?;;;;;;;;
6289;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;Yeah, it's still a nameless sniper. It's become quite a topic among us. She's still a cadet from the military academy, but at any rate she's got a good arm. It seems she's been brought all the way out here. Hah... to think they have to pull out even a little chick like that... this must be the end.;;;;;;;;
6290;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;*to Edward* So, you hooked up with your mechanic, huh? Not too shabby, sprout.;;;;;;;;
6291;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;A bratty little midget.;;;;;;;;
6292;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;"A normal guy like me isn't going to be part of some ""believe it or not"" episode with nutcases like you guys!";;;;;;;;
6293;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;Are you telling me to go back and put a corpse on trial?;;;;;;;;
6294;(Death Note);L Lawliet;If you use your head, you won't get fat even if you eat sweets.;;;;;;;;
6295;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;"Let me tell you about the difference between you and me. It's like the story of the monkey trying to capture the moon. However close he thinks he is to the moon, it's still just the reflection of the moon in the middle of the lake. No matter how he struggles to capture that ""moon"", he inevitably sinks to the bottom of that lake to no avail. You will never reach me.";;;;;;;;
6296;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;If the pride of a senshi means hurting each other, I don't want it. Nothing will come out of fighting. Fighting isn't the only way to solve things.;;;;;;;;
6297;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;One day, we will vanish. New senshi and new stars will be born. But you, Sailor Moon, you will forever be immortal. You will be the most beautiful star shining in the sky for eternity.;;;;;;;;
6298;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Maes Hughes;I'm as normal as they come and this is a contest of freaks! What do you want me to do, shoot my slingshot at him?;;;;;;;;
6299;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate.;;;;;;;;
6300;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;The great flow that maintains the universe, call it the cycle of life, the course of nature each one of us is just a small part of that part. One in the all. Yet without all the individual ones, the all can't exist. This world flows by following grander laws that we can't even imagine. To recognize that flow, to work in it. To decompose, and recreate, that is alchemy.;;;;;;;;
6301;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;I wasn't always fighting for love and justice. I was fighting for my friends and loved ones.;;;;;;;;
6302;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;Some memories... aren't meant to leave traces.;;;;;;;;
6303;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Kurogane;Don't look back. If you got something to do, then only look forward.;;;;;;;;
6304;(Trigun);Nicholas D. Wolfwood;[about Vash] The way he looked at me... it was as though he had shot the kid...;;;;;;;;
6305;(Trigun);Meryl Stryfe;Vash the Stampede... every time I observe his actions I can't help but sense something hidden deep within him, something we can't being to understand. But this much is certain: everyone who has become involved with him has somehow regained an emotion which was once lost.;;;;;;;;
6306;(Trigun);Nicholas D. Wolfwood;"I picked up my first gun at the age of seven. And I shot. I remember how strangely easy it was to pull the trigger. Ha. I actually laughed. Because that one shot was all that was needed to silence that sickening piece of garbage who had the nerve to call himself my guardian. Ha. It was that simple. And so I was free. Yes, tomorrow would be different. Hm. Tomorrow. As much as I wanted to believe, it only went from bad to worse. A vicious cycle... I didn't want other kids to grow up like me, so I started my own orphanage. It was gratifying work, I was actually doing something for the good of others. It was my place of peace and happiness... yet sometimes, I still think to myself ""there's no place worse than this planet. It's horrible here.""";;;;;;;;
6307;(Trigun);Nicholas D. Wolfwood;NEEDLENOGGIN!;;;;;;;;
6308;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;Dangerous toys are fun, but you can get hurt.;;;;;;;;
6309;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;"Those who make mistakes blame themselves and close their hearts. It's impossible to fix the mistake. Men can't return to the past. That's why they drink. Lushes, drunks, sliding alcohol down their throats to try to dilute the memories that can't be forgotten. Frank Marlon, the gunsmith, does nothing but drink, and questions the glass after it's empty. ""Am I wrong? Was I wrong?""";;;;;;;;
6310;(Trigun);Nicholas D. Wolfwood;Come again, Needle Noggin?;;;;;;;;
6311;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;[singing] Total slaughter, total slaughter. I won't leave a single man alive. La de da de die, genocide. La de da de dud, an ocean of blood. Let's begin the killing time.;;;;;;;;
6312;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;I meditate diligently every morning. The subject is Life and Love. I quit after three seconds.;;;;;;;;
6313;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;I don't let anyone in my sight get away, and my bullets never miss their mark. Especially if it's the heart of a beautiful lady... BANG.;;;;;;;;
6314;(Trigun);Meryl Stryfe;Does this man look like the legendary gunman Vash the Stampede? That droopy-eyed, weak-looking, bristle-headed, promiscuous-looking donut freak of a man?;;;;;;;;
6315;(Trigun);Nicholas D. Wolfwood;I always knew you were no mere mortal... but I had no idea that you were a cat.;;;;;;;;
6316;(Trigun);Vash the Stampede;"Hey, ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"", remember? What kind of church man are you?";;;;;;;;
6317;(Inuyasha);Naraku;You're not as slow as you look, monk.;;;;;;;;
6318;(Inuyasha);Naraku;Well, well, if it isn't the holy monk.;;;;;;;;
6319;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;*to Inuyasha* Your stupidity knows no boundaries. Run and hide while you can.;;;;;;;;
6320;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;The little man is having trouble holding his sword. *to Inuyasha*;;;;;;;;
6321;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;All that for a memory and a dead mortal girl. If I've known that this is all it took to make you fight, I would have killed her sooner. (to Inuyasha);;;;;;;;
6322;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;*to Inuyasha* You fight as though you're still a child.;;;;;;;;
6323;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;This scheme of yours is beneath me.  Should it fail, Jaken, you will die.;;;;;;;;
6324;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;Be not a fool, I have no such time to waste.;;;;;;;;
6325;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;*to Inuyasha* I quite miss you as well, little brother.;;;;;;;;
6326;(Inuyasha);Sesshomaru;Can it be that I'm afraid or is it merely I know not my own limit?;;;;;;;;
6327;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;I wish for a heart. A heart of the man whom I'll never allow to forget me.;;;;;;;;
6328;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;Tragic he said. I'm tragic?;;;;;;;;
6329;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;Stop coming after the jewel. I do not wish to waste more arrows.;;;;;;;;
6330;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;I despise you with my last breath. My spirit will not forget that all consuming hatred.  So long that you live, my spirit can not be free. *to Inuyasha*;;;;;;;;
6331;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;You vile beast. I despise you. You loathsome half man.;;;;;;;;
6332;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;Inuyasha, you and I were fated to never meet again.;;;;;;;;
6333;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Say please, before asking for favor.;;;;;;;;
6334;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I will hunt down Kikyou's killer and avenge her death;;;;;;;;
6335;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Well excuse me for making you sleep in the wild all the time.;;;;;;;;
6336;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;That's pretty bad when you can even give a half demon the creeps. *to Kagome*;;;;;;;;
6337;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Are you going to keep staring at me because it's ticking me off. If you got something to say, say it.;;;;;;;;
6338;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;It's nice not to be alone.;;;;;;;;
6339;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;He's thanking me? That can't be good. *about Inuyasha*;;;;;;;;
6340;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;I was wrong, kill him.;;;;;;;;
6341;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;Maybe it's just the morning light, but he looks pretty cool standing there with his sword. *about Inuyasha*;;;;;;;;
6342;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;You sent me into a battle armed with a mere hunch?;;;;;;;;
6343;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I'd rather give up my eye, than give up his sword. Maybe I'm not so worthless after all.;;;;;;;;
6344;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I'm gonna slit your stomach, take out your guts, and put them in a bowl. By the time I'm through with you, you're going to wish it was you who was dead.;;;;;;;;
6345;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Don't be stupid. You're just a human. So back off, shut up, and butt out. *to Kagome*;;;;;;;;
6346;(Inuyasha);Shippou;That's why Kagome sent me, so I can protect you from being protected by him.;;;;;;;;
6347;(Inuyasha);Shippou;Kagome, what do you have in your bag? Rocks?;;;;;;;;
6348;(Inuyasha);Shippou;Just apologize, even if you don't mean it. *to some kid, about Inuyasha*;;;;;;;;
6349;(Inuyasha);Shippou;Six innocent peasants down, hundreds of thousand more to go.;;;;;;;;
6350;(Inuyasha);Shippou;Aahhh someone saves me.;;;;;;;;
6351;(Inuyasha);Shippou;You shouldn't talk to yourself. People will wonder.;;;;;;;;
6352;(Inuyasha);Shippou;Why am I always the one handing out apologies?;;;;;;;;
6353;(Inuyasha);Sango;But is it necessary to keep stroking my leg while you talk. *to Miroku*;;;;;;;;
6354;(Inuyasha);Miroku;*while stomping on Inuyasha* Lay down, be silent, sleep, rest, sleep... how many times do I have to tell you...;;;;;;;;
6355;(Inuyasha);Miroku;This may come as something of a surprise, but I'm a sore loser.;;;;;;;;
6356;(Inuyasha);Miroku;You're a real sight for sore eyes. *to Kagome*;;;;;;;;
6357;(Inuyasha);Miroku;I must find a place to pawn this off.;;;;;;;;
6358;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;Someone the exact opposite of Inuyasha.  That's the perfect guy for me.;;;;;;;;
6359;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I didn't say get naked, stupid. I just can't stand seeing you in those clothes.;;;;;;;;
6360;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Think you're pretty smart, you old hag. (to Kaede);;;;;;;;
6361;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I would come up there and finish you off. If you didn't look half dead already.;;;;;;;;
6362;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;*guilty voice* Because of my carelessness Araragi-kun realized that his brain is slower than others.;;;;;;;;
6363;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;*to Araragi* A creature like you having a brain residing in his skull...is already a miracle in and of itself.;;;;;;;;
6364;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;*to Araragi* I'm suprised you know such useless things. This is the first time since birth that I've admired you.;;;;;;;;
6365;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;You.... Could it be that you're just an idiot? *to Senjougahara*;;;;;;;;
6366;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;I don't want that kind of twisted love.;;;;;;;;
6367;(Bakemonogatari);Meme Oshino;She's been like that ever since I bought a box of donuts and had one more than her.;;;;;;;;
6368;(Bakemonogatari);Meme Oshino;No one cares about Araragi-kun.;;;;;;;;
6369;(Bakemonogatari);Meme Oshino;I don't think much of you for sending a girl your age to the place where a wierd man lives.;;;;;;;;
6370;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Right now, I'm afraid of losing you. Although my life hasn't been very fortunate until now, I'm glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune. Because of that, I was able to fall for you. So we'll definitely do something, but I want to wait just a bit. So, right now, the last thing I can offer you... Is this starry sky.;;;;;;;;
6371;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Don't get me wrong. It's not like I'm worried about you. But if you don't come back I'll never forgive you.;;;;;;;;
6372;(Bakemonogatari);Nadeko Sengoku;You're all grown up, so you won't feel dirty looking at my body, right?;;;;;;;;
6373;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Don't move. Oh, my bad. I mean, you can move if you want, but it'd be very dangerous.;;;;;;;;
6374;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;"I told you, anything is OK, like saying you want me to end all my sentences with ""nyu"" for a week. Or that you want me to not wear underwear to school for a week. Or that you want me to wake you up every morning for a week, wearing nothing but an apron.";;;;;;;;
6375;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Anything at all. Just this once I'll fulfil whatever your wish is. Whether is world conquest, or eternal life, or to defeat the saiyans that are coming to earth.;;;;;;;;
6376;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;"Don't call me ""this chick"".";;;;;;;;
6377;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;By the way, Araragi-kun... I've never broken up with a man before. Hence, I won't be breaking up with you either.;;;;;;;;
6378;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;Come on. I don't like this trend of explaining anything and everything about my love life. It's impossible.;;;;;;;;
6379;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;If anyone else kills you, I'll kill that person.;;;;;;;;
6380;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;Being kind to everyone, simply means there's no one special.;;;;;;;;
6381;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;No one's gonna save me. People just accept help selfishly, for their own sake.;;;;;;;;
6382;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;Even crabs have to go on a journey sometime.;;;;;;;;
6383;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;You've got nice solid childbearing hips, so I think you're sure to have healthy babies. Uwehehehe;;;;;;;;
6384;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;And, Araragi-kun....I love you.;;;;;;;;
6385;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;Sunday, May 14th at 14:15:30--the moment I got Senjōgahara's phone number.;;;;;;;;
6386;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;If I fail to make my every-minute reports, a gang of 5,000 brutes will attack your whole family.;;;;;;;;
6387;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;My abusive language is alchemized through 40 kg copper, 25 kg of zinc, 15 kg of nickel, 5 kg of ice that keeps my cool, and 97 kg of spite.;;;;;;;;
6388;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Fine. I'll correct myself. I have no experience. I'm a virgin. More to the point, the only kind of girl who'd talk to an unappealing virgin like you are late-bloomer virgins like me!;;;;;;;;
6389;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Idiot! Don't spit while you talk! Your virginity might be contagious!;;;;;;;;
6390;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;If I may suggest, I recommend my waking you up every morning wearing nothing but an apron. Then I can cook you breakfast. Isn't it a man's fantasy to watch that from behind?;;;;;;;;
6391;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;"Is that so? Then I'll just use ""pathetic"" next time.";;;;;;;;
6392;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;"The word ""ignorant"" has a nice ring to it, so I don't mind being called that, but ""incompetent"" is going just a bit too far...";;;;;;;;
6393;(Bakemonogatari);Koyomi Araragi;There stood a high school boy, who for selfish reasons had twice beaten an elementary school girl unconscious, and had gotten all nihistically worked up about it. Actually, that's still me.;;;;;;;;
6394;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;Copper, 40g;;;;;;;;
6395;(Bakemonogatari);Senjougahara Hitagi;If I kill you, that means I'll be the one closest to you when you're on your deathbed. Isn't it romantic?;;;;;;;;
6396;(Prince Of Tennis);Wakashi Hiyoshi;Gekokujou.;;;;;;;;
6397;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Conrad Weller;Time gives us happiness, but it can also take everything away from us.;;;;;;;;
6398;(Kyo kara Maoh!);Conrad Weller;[To Yuuri Shibuya] Does your Majesty believe in Time? Time gives us happiness, but it can also take everything away from us. During the 15 years that I waited for your Majesty to grow up and for the day when you would come to this world, Time gave me happiness every day. And after you came to this world... This is my conclusion, made during all the time that I have been with you.;;;;;;;;
6399;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;Sorry, I saw an opening that just screamed 'ATTACK,' so I did, ha!;;;;;;;;
6400;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;Kakarot! Dodge this next attack, if you can!.. But even if I miss you... THIS WHOLE PLANET'S GOING UP IN SMOOOOKE!;;;;;;;;
6401;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;[Vegeta's last thought before he dies fighting Majin Buu] Bulma, Trunks. This is for you.;;;;;;;;
6402;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;What's wrong Frieza? Is your brain another one of your weak and under used muscles?;;;;;;;;
6403;(Dragon Ball);Krillin;Hey hun! I've got a great idea, let's trade! Yo take my spot and I'll fight Hercule!;;;;;;;;
6404;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;My ears do more than just frame my face.;;;;;;;;
6405;(Dragon Ball);Android 17;Tell me, are all you Saiyans so full of yourselves? Is this how you hide your incompetence? We androids will always be superior to your kind.;;;;;;;;
6406;(Dragon Ball);Android 17;[clapping] A beautiful speech, I can see it now, you truly are a prince with the royal blood of a Saiyan.;;;;;;;;
6407;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;How can androids have babies?;;;;;;;;
6408;(Dragon Ball);Trunks Brief;Father, you're so tough and proud, hard and cold like a rock. But still, deep down, your heart beats like mine does... I know you feel... I'm your son and I will always love you.;;;;;;;;
6409;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;While I was with you guys, I became more human. I didn't like that. I even have a family and started to like living on earth.;;;;;;;;
6410;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;Trunks, I never hugged you as a baby... let me hug you.;;;;;;;;
6411;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;I would rather be a brainless monkey than a heartless monster. (To Frieza);;;;;;;;
6412;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;Don't remind me. I'm mad enough to hurt somebody and pounding you just might be the therapy I need.;;;;;;;;
6413;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;There's only one certainty in life. A strong man stands above and conquers all!;;;;;;;;
6414;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;Let me ask you. Does a machine like yourself ever experience fear?;;;;;;;;
6415;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;I'm not going to lie to you, Vegeta, although the answer may be difficult for you to hear. This is the truth. Goku devoted his life to protecting the lives of other. Because of his selflessness, when he died, he was allowed to keep his body and travel to King Kai's Planet. You, on the other hand, have spent your life in pursuit of your own selfish desires. You've caused too much pain. When you die, you will not receive the same reward.;;;;;;;;
6416;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;I could go one step farther if I wanted to.;;;;;;;;
6417;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;Not bad, for an early prototype.;;;;;;;;
6418;(Dragon Ball);Piccolo;Even with the energy you took from me, my power is still far greater than your own.;;;;;;;;
6419;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;You never thought to kill, or fight for revenge. Only to test your limits, and to push yourself beyond them, to become the strongest you could possibly be. How can a Saiyan fight like that, and at the same time be so gentle that he wouldn't hurt a fly? It makes me angry just thinking about it. But perhaps it is my anger that has made me blind to the truth for so long. I see it now. This day has made it all too clear. You're better than me, Kakarot. You are the best...;;;;;;;;
6420;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;Are you ready now, to witness a power not seen for thousands of years?;;;;;;;;
6421;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;It looks like they only want me, and that's exactly who they'll get.;;;;;;;;
6422;(Dragon Ball);Vegeta;You can take control of my mind and my body, but there is one thing a Saiyan always keep... his PRIDE!;;;;;;;;
6423;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;That's what you think, Captain Cocky!;;;;;;;;
6424;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;Well, this blows.;;;;;;;;
6425;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;We'd rather die than abandon our comrade!!!;;;;;;;;
6426;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;Sorry, but it doesn't matter if you're a woman or even a child... I don't go easy on anybody who hurts my nakama.;;;;;;;;
6427;(Fairy Tail);Gray Fullbuster;I am an ice sculpture mage. I can make anything.;;;;;;;;
6428;(Fairy Tail);Erza Scarlet;It is always sad to part with those whom you love, but your companions will help you bear that sadness.;;;;;;;;
6429;(Fairy Tail);Gajeel Redfox;Keeheehe. I like him. I'm going to make him my cat.;;;;;;;;
6430;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;What's the point of magic to begin with... if I can't use it to protect my friends?;;;;;;;;
6431;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;It's not a crime! Caring about your friends is not a crime!;;;;;;;;
6432;(Fairy Tail);Lucy Heartfilia;"Stellar Spirits are not ""Shields"".";;;;;;;;
6433;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;Why do you find it easy to kill? These are lives dammit!;;;;;;;;
6434;(Fairy Tail);Natsu Dragneel;Mages of Fairy Tail... specialize in property damage!;;;;;;;;
6435;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;To become Hokage is my dream!;;;;;;;;
6436;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Nothing's perfect, the world's not perfect, but it's there for us, trying the best it can. That's what makes it so damn beautiful.;;;;;;;;
6437;(Prince Of Tennis);Tezuka Kunimitsu;The ones who suffer from the loss of the game, become stronger. They will challenge us by throwing away everything like their pride and past glories.;;;;;;;;
6438;(Saiyuki);Cho Hakkai;Even if you destroy the world, the world you wish for won't come.;;;;;;;;
6439;(Dragon Ball);Krillin;It looked like it was going to be germ warfare, but the Bacterian fight got me ready for that.;;;;;;;;
6440;(Dragon Ball);Krillin;First it was that sewer-face and now I'm up against a superhero.;;;;;;;;
6441;(Dragon Ball);Bulma;Yamcha, I was worried about you. For all I knew, you were dead in a ditch in a country you can't pronounce. You'll have to make this up to me. And you're going to enjoy it.;;;;;;;;
6442;(Dragon Ball);Krillin;(after Goku moves a huge boulder all by himself) Krillin wants everybody to know he's speechless right now.;;;;;;;;
6443;(Dragon Ball);Krillin;(after Master Roshi tells him they have to dig in a farm) First we're the milkmen, and now we're stinkin' farmers. We never did this in Orin Temple.;;;;;;;;
6444;(Dragon Ball);Master Roshi;But, you will not go in there with hopes of winning the tournament the first time you compete. To do so would be arrogant! And arrogance is for fools, not warriors! So you will enter the tournament with the sole purpose of improving your fighting skills.;;;;;;;;
6445;(Dragon Ball);Master Roshi;(Master Roshi is reaching for Launch's buttocks as Krillin barges in and makes him angry) Do you time this?;;;;;;;;
6446;(Dragon Ball);Bulma;Look Goku, you can go out in public and have your hair sticking out in every direction if you want to, but not me!;;;;;;;;
6447;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;Hey! It looks like now is a good time to do a little tail fishing!;;;;;;;;
6448;(Dragon Ball);Son Goku;Where is your tail? (Searching for tail in Bulma's butt);;;;;;;;
6449;(Claymore);Galatea;This might come a little late but... you people make me sick.;;;;;;;;
6450;(Claymore);Galatea;Don't cry. It will make your face even uglier.;;;;;;;;
6451;(Claymore);Galatea;Looks like most of what you say immediately vanishes from your head once you say it. I really envy you for a brain with such a lively metabolism.;;;;;;;;
6452;(Claymore);Riful;Sorry... I really... want to let you savor your moment of glory a little longer. But I really can't be having this. After all is said and done... he is still my man after all.;;;;;;;;
6453;(Claymore);Riful;My goal isn't your death. I will just torture you, make you awaken and then make you my friends!;;;;;;;;
6454;(Claymore);Riful;Being thrown away by humans, devoted to them even though you aren't one of them... and once they are finished with you, they have you end your life yourself... and not even an ounce of gratitude for all that. On the contrary: for your whole life you are hated and reviled. It really is idiotic. We are a different species after all. Once you start seeing things that way, it all becomes very easy to accept. Do humans shed tears for the birds, pigs, cows and sheep that become their food? Of course they don't. They are a different species after all. That is nature. That is the truth. That is Providence. Your way of thinking up to now was the warped one.;;;;;;;;
6455;(Claymore);Irene;Live, Clare! Your staying alive is the only proof that Teresa ever existed.;;;;;;;;
6456;(Claymore);Irene;Teresa had plenty of chances to kill Priscilla. The reason she didn't was that after being with you, Teresa's heart lost the toughness of a warrior. The Teresa I knew would have dispatched Priscilla without hesitation at their first encounter. After she met you, she was no longer fit for battle. That's why she died. That's the truth. But I think Teresa was happy.;;;;;;;;
6457;(Claymore);Irene;Seeing the same thing at that time and place, either moving forward or running away... I suppose that's what separates those who are fit for battle from those who are not.;;;;;;;;
6458;(Claymore);Ophelia;[Last words] Well done. You win. As promised, I entrust you with everything. After all I can't do any more at this point anyways. Man, this really annoys me. I really hate people, who put their life on the line like you. Now quickly, finish me off. If you don't hurry, I'll regenerate again. Since you will be fighting in my stead, I won't stand for it if you lose, understand?;;;;;;;;
6459;(Claymore);Ophelia;The idea that you can't die yet because you still have something to protect... that is the foolish illusion of the weak.;;;;;;;;
6460;(Claymore);Ophelia;"This is called the ""Rippling Sword"". ""Rippling Ophelia""... Great name, don't you think? But it's not too well known yet. Because most of the people who've seen it are dead.";;;;;;;;
6461;(Claymore);Ophelia;Really! How marvellous! You two are simply marvellous. Which one of you should I kill? Which one of you would be more fun to watch as you wail in agony?;;;;;;;;
6462;(Claymore);Ophelia;Don't you think it's beautiful? That rosy red that spreads only where the body is wounded. Shall I paint you in that lovely red... little boy?;;;;;;;;
6463;(Claymore);Teresa;[Last words] All right then, I'll put you out of your misery. [Her hands are sliced off] Eh?;;;;;;;;
6464;(Claymore);Teresa;You can come after me as many times as you want. I'll cut you down every time.;;;;;;;;
6465;(Claymore);Teresa;Say your prayers, wretches. Filth like you is even lower than Yoma. I'm going to kill... every last one of you.;;;;;;;;
6466;(Claymore);Teresa;This little girl, who's not even half my size... taught me that tears can flow even from these silver eyes.;;;;;;;;
6467;(Claymore);Teresa;Even if it's a rule... whether or not I follow it is up to me. Whether I obey the rule or break it and get killed by my comrades... is my choice.;;;;;;;;
6468;(Claymore);Clare;Don't be so quick to throw away your life. No matter how disgraceful or embarrassing it may be, you need to keep struggling to find your way out until the very end.;;;;;;;;
6469;(Claymore);Clare;You said I should have forgotten everything and lived as a human, but... there's no way I could do that. At that time, Teresa was everything to me. Everything I lost... my life, my voice, even my joy in living... Teresa gave those back to me. Teresa gave me everything. So I had no choice but to move forward. I wasn't strong enough to forget all that and continue living.;;;;;;;;
6470;(Claymore);Clare;My existence was nothing more to her than a stone by the side of the road. I wasn't enough to fill her belly. Or perhaps I didn't even get reflected in her eyes. I couldn't even hate the beast that killed Teresa. It was me, overcome by fear, that I could not forgive.;;;;;;;;
6471;(Shaman King);Johann Faust VIII;It's okay. There's no pain. [something snaps inside Morty] Oops! [grins maniacally at Yoh] I'm sorry.;;;;;;;;
6472;(Shaman King);Yoh Asakura;No one can predict the future, so it's pointless to fear the unknown.;;;;;;;;
6473;(Shaman King);Anna Kyoyama;I don't wear these beads just to make a fashion statement. These are my spirit beads - my link to the afterlife.;;;;;;;;
6474;(Shaman King);RYU;Boys, am I not always telling you to get in touch with your feelings, your inner gangster? Okay, actually I don't care about your feelings, never did, never will.;;;;;;;;
6475;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;I will protect Hinamori.;;;;;;;;

6494;(Shaman King);Tao Len;*referring to Jun* Look at her! Because she hasn't got any boyfriends around she fawns all over her guardian ghost.;;;;;;;;
6495;(Shaman King);Horohoro;What are you talking about, Ryu?! That's no damsel, that's a dude!;;;;;;;;
6496;(Shaman King);RYU;When you get a piece of Ryu you get the whole pie!;;;;;;;;
6497;(Shaman King);Yoh Asakura;There is no sense in worrying about something you cannot control, so why bother?;;;;;;;;
6498;(Shaman King);Manta Oyamada;Don't enter a mans bath like that!!!;;;;;;;;
6499;(Shaman King);Yoh Asakura;Many things can be achieved, as long as you believe in it.;;;;;;;;
6500;(Shaman King);Tao Len;Are you a coward...OR ARE YOU A MAN OF AMERICA?!;;;;;;;;
6501;(Shaman King);Johann Faust VIII;I'm Faust VIII, your opponent. Please be gentle.;;;;;;;;
6502;(Shaman King);Johann Faust VIII;How rude! You knocked his block off, and you didn't even have the courtesy to yell 'Heads up'!;;;;;;;;
6503;(Shaman King);Johann Faust VIII;And now it's time for formal introductions. Eliza, my darling, meet Yoh Asakura. Yoh Asakura, meet your doom!;;;;;;;;
6504;(Shaman King);Tao Len;Your friend thinks he can win the prize crown, but he has no hope whatsoever. He is a mere shadow of a true shaman and he will be the first in a long line to perish in my hands.;;;;;;;;
6505;(Shaman King);Johann Faust VIII;Let's see what kind of heart you have!;;;;;;;;
6506;(Shaman King);Amidamaru;I will stay by your side, my friend. Know that I am here, and that I am sorry. I am sorry that... I failed you. After waiting 600 years I made a beginner's mistake. I underestimated my enemy.;;;;;;;;
6507;(Shaman King);Manta Oyamada;[thinking] Step awaaaay from the psycho...;;;;;;;;
6508;(Shaman King);Manta Oyamada;That was the sound of the last train back to my house. And once again, I missed it. Our English class always gets out late on Tuesdays, so I have to walk home. But that's OK, because I like English. And the walk home's not so bad. Usually.;;;;;;;;
6509;(Shaman King);Yoh Asakura;The easiest way to test a person's real ability is under extreme conditions. Therefore, it's appropriate to choose the Shaman King through fighting.;;;;;;;;
6510;(Shaman King);Anna Kyoyama;*to Yoh* Because I aim to be the First Lady of the shaman world... You will become Shaman King, whether you want to or not.;;;;;;;;
6511;(Shaman King);Manta Oyamada;*referring to Yoh* [annoyed] Why does he always seem so carefree? He doesn't study... He listens to his favorite music... He even watches the rivers and stars!.. I wish I could live like that...;;;;;;;;
6512;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Bismarck Waldstein;Strength that knows no boundaries is merely violence.;;;;;;;;
6513;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;Only once every hundred years can a Firebender experience this kind of power.;;;;;;;;
6514;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Roku;If I had been more decisive, and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin, and stopped the war before it started. I offer you this wisdom, Aang, you must be decisive.;;;;;;;;
6515;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);King Bumi;I didn't know what or when, but I knew I'd know it when I knew it!;;;;;;;;
6516;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;I am not Toph! I am Melon Lord! (Toph laughs maniacally);;;;;;;;
6517;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;All right! Team Avatar is back! Air, water, earth, fire- (grabs a bunch of leaves) fan, and sword! (his leaf limps);;;;;;;;
6518;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.;;;;;;;;
6519;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;*referring to the man that took her mothers life* I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him. But... I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it, or if it's because I'm strong enough not to.;;;;;;;;
6520;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;(to Katara) I know who killed your mother.;;;;;;;;
6521;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;The past can be a great teacher. (trips over a wire, opens a spike trap, and manages to blow himself over it just in time and looks back fearfully) Zuko? I think the past is trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;
6522;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;(to himself, after revealing to Aang that he was the one who sent Combustion Man) Ugh, why do I have to be so stupid? How could I tell them that I sent an assassin after them? Couldn't I say that Azula did it? They would've believed that! Stupid! (Hits his head);;;;;;;;
6523;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Uh, Toph, I think your feet need their eyes checked.;;;;;;;;
6524;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;"(gazing at Zuko with a dark look) You might have everyone else buying your... ""transformation"", but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. So let me tell you something right now. You make one step backward, one slip up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends, right then and there. Permanently. (exits the room, leaving Zuko shocked)";;;;;;;;
6525;(Junjou Romantica);Shinobu Takatsuki;To be loved out of sympathy is more devastating than to be rejected.;;;;;;;;
6526;(Junjou Romantica);Yoh Miyagi;I wonder... isn't it that when you become an adult, you have freedom to explore such a large world. I wonder why is it I feel that the world is so constricted at this moment.;;;;;;;;
6527;(Junjou Romantica);Yoh Miyagi;Why is it that I'm anxious when I love him?.. No. I love him, that's why I'm anxious. It's because I love you that even if I take off the armor I've worn all my life, I'll still chase after you.;;;;;;;;
6528;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;I'd been wondering all this time, whether there's any meaning to a failed love. Is it something that will disappear, the same as something that never existed. Now I know, there is meaning...there was a meaning...right here.;;;;;;;;
6529;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;To cry because there is something you want to do and to cry because you can't find it. Which is more painful? The only thing I can say is even with all the words I have now, I can't stop her tears.;;;;;;;;
6530;(Honey and Clover);Yuuta Takemoto;To wish for your own happiness is sometimes coupled with another's unhappiness. Since I couldn't pray for my own happiness, I prayed to the moon in the night sky for the happiness of the one whose warm hand I held.;;;;;;;;
6531;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;Why am I so bad at being good?;;;;;;;;
6532;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;Please tell me you're here because the Firelord is a big wimp and you didn't need to take him down.;;;;;;;;
6533;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Pathik;Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras! Chakras, chakras! Chakra sandwich tastes good! Yum!;;;;;;;;
6534;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. (Hama is shocked that Katara managed to resist her bloodbending) My bending Hama, is more powerful than yours. Your technique is useless on me! (draws water from the ground and forms a ring around herself before directing it at Hama);;;;;;;;
6535;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sozin;With Roku gone and the Great Comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad so I wiped out the Air Temples, but somehow the new Avatar eluded me. I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. I know he's hiding out there somewhere: the Fire Nation's greatest threat, the last Airbender.;;;;;;;;
6536;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sozin;Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible. I have a vision for the future, Roku.;;;;;;;;
6537;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;(Zuko is standing before a huge portrait of Fire Lord Sozin)It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. (Sarcastically) Make sure he gets your good side.;;;;;;;;
6538;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;Bad skin?! Normal teenagers worry about bad skin, I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson... ON MY FACE!;;;;;;;;
6539;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;"[after winning a game of beach volleyball/""Kuai Ball""] Yes! We defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation! [pause] Well, that was fun.";;;;;;;;
6540;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;Ladies and gentlemen, THE FLAMEO'S!;;;;;;;;
6541;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;"Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, ""stay flamin'!""";;;;;;;;
6542;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Ty Lee;Nice speech, Azula! It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way!;;;;;;;;
6543;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;I've seen enough of Ba Sing Sei. And I can't even see!;;;;;;;;
6544;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;Looks like Long Feng is long gone! (laughs) Oh, I've been waiting to use that one!;;;;;;;;
6545;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Pathik;I know I am not the person you expected...and I did not expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now.;;;;;;;;
6546;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;Don't you know that fans only make flames stronger?;;;;;;;;
6547;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Ty Lee;[Ty Lee unleashes a furry of jabs into the back of a Kyoshi warrior, dropping her, and unleashes a final taunt] You are not prettier than we are.;;;;;;;;
6548;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;It's always best to believe in one's self but with a little help from others can be a great blessing!;;;;;;;;
6549;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth.;;;;;;;;

6551;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;It won't work. You country-bumpkins will stand out a mile. [Eats food with her hands];;;;;;;;
6552;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but (sniffs) it's just so sad!;;;;;;;;
6553;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Ty Lee;[looking through a periscope at the dust cloud Toph made] Hey... Look at that dust cloud. It's so...poofy! [Mimes by closing and opening her hand] Poof!;;;;;;;;
6554;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Mai;*referring to Azula* She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me, I'm not going into that wall sludge juice. [shudders];;;;;;;;
6555;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it tastes like sand. I never thought I would miss the taste of mud so much.;;;;;;;;
6556;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;I'm going to spend my vacation AT THE LIBRARY!;;;;;;;;
6557;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;Gooood morning earth-bending student!;;;;;;;;
6558;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;Aang, this is my friend Foo-Foo Cuddly Poofs, Foo-Foo Cuddly Poofs, Aang.;;;;;;;;
6559;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;[yelling angrily toward the sky] You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! Come on! STRIKE ME! You've never held back before!;;;;;;;;
6560;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[aiming at a small prey animal] You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat.;;;;;;;;
6561;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;The stars sure are beautiful tonight. [angrily] Too bad you can't see them, Toph!;;;;;;;;
6562;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;Azula always lies, Azula always lies.;;;;;;;;
6563;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name, the Fancy Dancer?;;;;;;;;
6564;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Toph Bei Fong;[after Aang enters the ring] Do people really want to see TWO little girls fighting out here?;;;;;;;;
6565;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[after finding his stolen boomerang] Boomerang! You do always come back!;;;;;;;;
6566;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Mai;[About Omashu] There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.;;;;;;;;
6567;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Mai;[to Azula] Please tell me you're here to kill me.;;;;;;;;
6568;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;No! Bad Fire Nation baby!;;;;;;;;
6569;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara's busy, I guess it's up to me.;;;;;;;;
6570;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.;;;;;;;;
6571;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;[as Zhao threatens the moon spirit] Whatever you do to that spirit, I'll unleash on you tenfold! Let it go now!;;;;;;;;
6572;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;[to an unconscious Aang] I finally have you. But I can't get you home because of this blizzard. There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight, and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.;;;;;;;;
6573;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;[to Katara] You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.;;;;;;;;
6574;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[after Princess Yue unexpectedly kisses him] Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused.;;;;;;;;
6575;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;I laugh at gravity all the time. Hahaha, gravity...;;;;;;;;
6576;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Jeong Jeong;To master the bending disciplines you must first master discipline itself, but you have no interest in this so I have no interest in you.;;;;;;;;
6577;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Jeong Jeong;Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.;;;;;;;;
6578;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Jeong Jeong;Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control. He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.;;;;;;;;
6579;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;You want to walk into a Fire Nation town when they're all fired up with their, you know, fire?;;;;;;;;
6580;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;[to Zuko] You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends too?;;;;;;;;
6581;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;That's how Sokka started. Now look at him! He thinks he's an Earthbender!;;;;;;;;
6582;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;I'm too young to die!;;;;;;;;
6583;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?;;;;;;;;
6584;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;[soothing Appa] Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.;;;;;;;;
6585;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;*to Katara* Try to understand. I need to capture him to restore something I've lost. [Katara jerks her head away from Zuko] Perhaps in exchange, I can restore something you've lost.;;;;;;;;

6593;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);King Bumi;*to Aang* You need to find someone who WAITS and LISTENS before striking.;;;;;;;;
6594;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);King Bumi;Neutral Jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.;;;;;;;;

6601;(Honey and Clover);Takumi Nomiya;‎[to Takumi Myama] Why are you blocking us when you have someone else that you like? We can easily see her feelings towards you so there's no way you haven't realized what's there. Yet you just leave the situation half-finished. Aren't you just saving her for when things don't work out with your favorite?;;;;;;;;
6602;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;Its ony one simple thing, but why do I feel like forever I cannot reach it. Only keep on and on, staying at the same spot.;;;;;;;;
6603;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;Look what I found! These are packue berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant... THAT, or makaoli berries that cause blindness.;;;;;;;;
6604;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;Hmm... *puts on a happy face* Delectable tea... *changes to serious face* or deadly poison?..;;;;;;;;
6605;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;*to Zuko* You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. It's leaves make a tea sooo delicious, it's heartbreaking... THAT, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous.;;;;;;;;
6606;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Roku;In the avatar state... You're at your most powerful, but you're also...at your most vulnerable. If you're killed in the avatar state, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the avatar will cease to exist.;;;;;;;;
6607;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Roku;The avatar state is a defense mechanism - designed to empower you with all the skills and knowledge of the past avatars. The glow is the combination of all your past lives. Focusing their energy to your body.;;;;;;;;
6608;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;*to Zuko* Why would father want YOU back? Except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him!;;;;;;;;
6609;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;*to Zuko* You know, father blames uncle for the loss of north pole... and he considers YOU a miserable failure for not finding the avatar.;;;;;;;;
6610;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Azula;"[sarcastically] In my country, we exchange a pleasant ""hello"" before asking questions.";;;;;;;;
6611;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;*to Kikyo* I swear... I will never let Naraku harm you.;;;;;;;;
6612;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Are you stupid?;;;;;;;;
6613;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Don't you faint on me, you stupid girl.;;;;;;;;
6614;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Windscar!;;;;;;;;
6615;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Hey, Shippo. Your village called.They're asking for their idiot!;;;;;;;;
6616;(Inuyasha);Naraku;I am not going to kill you - I am going to break you.;;;;;;;;
6617;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;[with a bow and arrow ready to fire] Not as pretty as his, huh? What would you know about it? You live in a time where they don't even have SHAMPOO.;;;;;;;;
6618;(Inuyasha);Kagome Higurashi;[repeatedly] Inuyasha, sit, boy.;;;;;;;;
6619;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Mighty Katara..? I like that.;;;;;;;;
6620;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;Who knew that floating on a piece of drift wood for three weeks with no food or water... and sea volchers waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense.;;;;;;;;
6621;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;I was in the avatar state... But I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary...;;;;;;;;
6622;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.;;;;;;;;
6623;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;[to Zuko about Aang] It was not by chance that for generations people have been searching for him, and now you have found him.;;;;;;;;
6624;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;*to Aang* Protection and power are overrated. I think you are very wise to choose happiness and love.;;;;;;;;
6625;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;You are not the man you used to be. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you ever used to be. And now you have come at the crossroads of destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.;;;;;;;;
6626;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;[to Iroh, while he's bathing] Enough. we need to leave now! Get out of the water.;;;;;;;;
6627;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!;;;;;;;;
6628;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);King Bumi;The guards will show you to your chamber. The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!;;;;;;;;
6629;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);King Bumi;There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar! Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?!;;;;;;;;
6630;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;*referring to Sokka* He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.;;;;;;;;
6631;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!;;;;;;;;
6632;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;Simple: girls are better at fixing pants than guys, and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.;;;;;;;;
6633;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;This whole Avatar thing... maybe the monks made a mistake.;;;;;;;;
6634;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;*after Zuko defeats Zhao* So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? Disgraceful. Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious. [Iroh and Zuko leaves];;;;;;;;
6635;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[to himself as he chops at the ice] I'm just a guy with a boomerang. I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.;;;;;;;;
6636;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Iroh;*after meeting Aang for the first time* Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.;;;;;;;;
6637;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;[after Zuko calls him a child] Well, you're just a teenager.;;;;;;;;
6638;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[to Aang, who is playing around] Stop! Stop it right now! What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with the war going on.;;;;;;;;
6639;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;[to Katara] If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear.;;;;;;;;
6640;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Aang;[to Katara] Come... closer... closer... Will you go penguin sledding with me?;;;;;;;;
6641;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Sokka;[sarcastically, after Aang tells him about his flying bison] Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister.;;;;;;;;
6642;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Zuko;I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar!;;;;;;;;
6643;(Avatar: The Last Airbender);Katara;My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow...the Avatar will return to save the world.;;;;;;;;

6645;(Death Note);Ryuk;All humans die the same, the place they go after death isn't decided upon by a god it is Mu (nothingness).;;;;;;;;
6646;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;It's impossible to feel exactly the same as someone else... but when you both care for each other, your hearts are able to draw a little closer together. I think that's what it means to make your hearts as one.;;;;;;;;
6647;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;There's a lot of products that you can buy with money...but my love is the only limited product that only you can have.;;;;;;;;
6648;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;There was no place for me, so I had to make one for myself, and then I realized, I had a place, but I was the only one in it. I didn't know any other way to live.;;;;;;;;
6649;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;I've heard similar threats from a number of poor fools whose memories I keep alive by dancing on their tombstones!;;;;;;;;
6650;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;I loathe all things, I despise every living creature who's bound to time.;;;;;;;;
6651;(Inuyasha);Kikyo;To live is to die, to die is to live. Pure is unpure, unpure is pure.;;;;;;;;

6654;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;If history repeats itself, and moves in a circular path, then believing that whatever force is turning it is perfect, is all we can do as we move ahead. Pushed along by forces beyond our control, waiting, for the blade to be swung.;;;;;;;;
6655;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;If I really liked him I should hope for his happiness. But like you said in the car, I actually hoped they would break up.;;;;;;;;
6656;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;The person you like the most, likes you back the most. It seems so simple. But why is it? It feels like it will never come together...forever like this...;;;;;;;;
6657;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;"So shut up about ""destiny"" and...how people can't change! 'Cause... unlike me... you're not a ""failure"".";;;;;;;;
6658;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Sasuke! Sasuke! Sasuke! What does he have that I don't have?!;;;;;;;;
6659;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Sasuke, I always knew you were alone. In the beginning I was glad because I thought you were like me - I wanted to talk to you! But you... didn't speak. You always had everyone watching you. You could do everything and we were too different. So I decided that you would become my rival. I didn't want to lose because I was called a loser all the time. Even when we became Team 7, I still thought this way. I always tried to lie but... but the truth is... I always wanted to be like you. I aspired to be like you. Because of that... I was glad that you wanted to fight me.;;;;;;;;
6660;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;When I'm with Iruka-sensei, I think if that's what having a father is like... *to Sasuke* When I'm with you, I think if that's what having a brother is like.;;;;;;;;
6661;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Sakura-chan, you sure do love Sasuke, don't you?;;;;;;;;
6662;(Naruto);Might Guy;DYNAMIC ENTRY!;;;;;;;;
6663;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;[after learning Guy Sensei's name. Might Guy] Yeah, mighty stupid looking guy!;;;;;;;;
6664;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;Hmhmhmhm, I think I will play with you a bit before killing you!;;;;;;;;
6665;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;Hmm... Itachi... it would be annoying if he moved around a lot. Perhaps we should cut off a leg or two?;;;;;;;;
6666;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;I'll enjoy shaving you to death.;;;;;;;;
6667;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;Konoha's Uchiha clan and the Mist's Seven Shinobi-gatana seem petty before his name.;;;;;;;;
6668;(Naruto);Kimimaro;Against the power of will I posses... The capability of my body is nothing.;;;;;;;;
6669;(Naruto);Kimimaro;[after Naruto does his Shadow Clone Jutsu] Oh, there sure is a lot of garbage scattered around here. But, trash is just trash after all. It simply needs to be cleaned up.;;;;;;;;
6670;(Naruto);Kimimaro;I don't hate the darkness. It was IN the darkness that I was raised.;;;;;;;;
6671;(Naruto);Kimimaro;I've been wondering... There must be a purpose for people being born into this world. Why are we here? What does it mean? I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I realized that finding our purpose IS the meaning. That's why we're here. And the ones who find it... They're the only ones who are truly free.;;;;;;;;
6672;(Naruto);Kimimaro;*referring to Orochimaru* I am not his pawn..! He is the one, the only one who ever gave my life meaning!! But how could the likes of you EVER UNDERSTAND THAT?!?;;;;;;;;
6673;(Naruto);Kimimaro;I will see the truth of this world... LORD OROCHIMARU WILL SHOW ME!!!;;;;;;;;
6674;(Naruto);Kimimaro;I see...since I am no longer going to be Lord Orochimaru's vessel, my duty is to protect the vessel.;;;;;;;;
6675;(Naruto);Kimimaro;You've only seen one of my dances.;;;;;;;;
6676;(Naruto);Kimimaro;Lets see, how should I kill you?;;;;;;;;
6677;(Naruto);Kimimaro;[to the Sound Ninja Four] Which do you prefer? To die, or to obey?;;;;;;;;
6678;(Naruto);Kimimaro;Is there really a god? If there is one, why does he keep me confined in here?;;;;;;;;
6679;(Naruto);Kimimaro;If Tayuya comes back, I'll kill her.;;;;;;;;
6680;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Akamaru, what's wrong boy? Have you forgotten my scent? We've always been together haven't we? We grew up together. Akamaru please, somewhere in there, there has to be a part of you that remembers. Show me that you remember. AKAMARU! Forgive me. Can you? I know that I've brought you nothing but pain and suffering. I broke my word. I swore I'd always protect you. Akamaru I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't a better master. I'm here. Here for you. Forever.;;;;;;;;
6681;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;I called you an idiot, idiot!;;;;;;;;
6682;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;It's not bad enough they buried us alive in the oversized dung heap, but now they're stealing our chakra. You gotta give these guys credit for thoroughness!;;;;;;;;
6683;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;A wall's a wall and there's no wall I can't punch a hole through!;;;;;;;;
6684;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Hinata, untie the ropes before you faint.;;;;;;;;
6685;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;I must be a pretty pathetic owner for you to have bitten me, Akamaru....;;;;;;;;
6686;(Naruto);Kankuro;A fair warning... we ninja of the Sand aren't as easygoing as those of the Leaf. But getting close to Kuroari so carelessly...isn't good!;;;;;;;;
6687;(Naruto);Kankuro;[Thinking] What a sucker. He doesn't know I can re-establish control over my puppet within a blink of an eye. It's what makes me an expert puppet master. And so what if Crow's body is out of commission? I don't need his body. Every part of him is a lethal weapon. [To Shino] Looks like you underestimated me, bug boy. For the last time! There's enough poison on that to drop an elephant, so you're dead.;;;;;;;;
6688;(Naruto);Kankuro;You tick me off. I hate short people anyway. And you're so impertinent for someone younger than me. It makes me want to break you.;;;;;;;;
6689;(Naruto);Kankuro;But I want to play around before some noisy people come!;;;;;;;;
6690;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Gai...what I said earlier...I was out of line. I was being a self-righteous fool. I realize now that if I'd been in your shoes, I probably couldn't have stopped him, either.;;;;;;;;
6691;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I don't know what this boy means to you, Gai, but I shouldn't have to tell you that we never bring our personal feelings into play. I didn't think you were capable of it.;;;;;;;;
6692;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I've lived longer than you. And times have been bad. I know the pain of loss. You and I haven't really been fortunate. It's true. But it could be worse. For me, and for you, too... We've found good friends, haven't we? Because of your losses, you should understand.;;;;;;;;
6693;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe the traffic.;;;;;;;;
6694;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Sorry I'm late guys, a black cat crossed my path so I had to go the long way.;;;;;;;;
6695;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;[thinking] If I'm still sane by the time I finish their training it'll be a miracle!;;;;;;;;
6696;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I will show you my own move.;;;;;;;;
6697;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;A ninja must see underneath the underneath.;;;;;;;;
6698;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Leaf Village Secret-Finger Justu...1,000 Years of Death!!! *sticks his fingers up Naruto's ass*;;;;;;;;
6699;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Hmmm...how do I put this? My first impression of this group...you're a bunch of idiots!;;;;;;;;
6700;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;[about the inefficacy of his attack against Tsunade] Did it not penetrate deep enough because of her fat breasts?;;;;;;;;
6701;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;The more you want something, the harder it is to wait for it.;;;;;;;;
6702;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;Mm, she's strong and scary. I bet she's single.;;;;;;;;
6703;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;[About Naruto] Well that's typical. Not happy unless he's giving people a heart attack.;;;;;;;;
6704;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;[when Naruto transforms into a woman in front of the whole class] CUT THE STUPID TRICKS! THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!!;;;;;;;;
6705;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;[as a child] Why should I be sad?! My parents died protecting the village from the monster fox. They're heroes, and I'm the son of those heroes! If I cry, it's because I'm happy! I'm not even sad that they went and left me all alone...;;;;;;;;
6706;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;I hate the fox, but the boy - I don't hate the boy.;;;;;;;;
6707;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;"It seems like the small leaves in the Village of Konoha have inherited that ""will of fire"" you spoke of, Third. The fire on the leaves will eventually burn greater and stronger... It will flash its light and protect this village.";;;;;;;;
6708;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;When a person dies, he disappears, along with his past, current lifestyle, and his future. Many people die in missions and wars. They die easily and in surprisingly simple ways. Hayate was one of them. Those who die have goals and dreams. But everyone has something as important as those. Parents, siblings, friends, lovers... people who are important to you. They trust and help each other. The bond between the people important to you ever since birth and the string that binds them becomes thicker and stronger as time goes by... It's beyond reason. Those bound to you by that string will do that because it is important.;;;;;;;;
6709;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;Billboard brow!!!;;;;;;;;
6710;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;Oh, I'm sorry. Her head's so empty, so I mistook her for a vase and put flowers in her. You might want to spit that out quick, though. Those can be quite poisonous.;;;;;;;;
6711;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;I believe you have the potential to bloom into something even more beautiful than the cosmos.;;;;;;;;
6712;(Naruto);Haku;I am of no more use as his tool. Please, kill me.;;;;;;;;
6713;(Naruto);Haku;Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing...that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands... But don't you see? It's an empty existence... to go on living... alone and unloved... when defeat's already cost you your dream!;;;;;;;;
6714;(Naruto);Haku;Can you understand? Not having a dream... not being needed by anyone... The pain of merely being alive.;;;;;;;;
6715;(Naruto);Haku;That is when I realized that in all of the world no one needed me. I was alone.;;;;;;;;
6716;(Naruto);Haku;I'm sure that the boy I killed, who shared that skill, must also have grown up knowing the pain of which I speak. We are special. We are powerful. And we are feared.;;;;;;;;
6717;(Naruto);Haku;I want to make his dreams come true...;;;;;;;;
6718;(Naruto);Haku;Is there... somebody precious to you?;;;;;;;;
6719;(Naruto);Gaara;I took the life of the woman I was supposed to call mother in the process of being born... in order to become the world's strongest shinobi... I became the incarnation of sand...;;;;;;;;
6720;(Naruto);Gaara;It's too bad I don't think of you as anything. If you get in my way... I'll kill you.;;;;;;;;
6721;(Naruto);Gaara;BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! MY BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!;;;;;;;;
6722;(Naruto);Gaara;You can make a rain of 1,000 needles. I will make it rain blood.;;;;;;;;
6723;(Naruto);Gaara;Bitter crimson tears flow from lifeless eyes, and mingle with the endless sands... Bestowing ever greater power upon the demon god.;;;;;;;;
6724;(Naruto);Gaara;People cannot win against their loneliness.;;;;;;;;
6725;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;[When Ino visits him in the hospital] Hehe. I'm also the type that gets girls to visit him. Take that, Shikamaru!;;;;;;;;
6726;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;I'm not fat, I'm pleasingly plump!;;;;;;;;
6727;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;This punch is heavier than life itself!;;;;;;;;
6728;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;Chubbies rule!;;;;;;;;
6729;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;Time's a-wastin' people, let's go!;;;;;;;;
6730;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;*to Ichigo* I thought you were interesting before, but now you're just a creepy kid.;;;;;;;;
6731;(Bleach);Ganju Shiba;There ain't a single coward who'd turn tail and run from just that! Not among the men of the Shiba clan!;;;;;;;;
6732;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;*to Ichigo, after he released his bankai for the first time* What is that? Are you saying that this small thing is a bankai? Isn't it just the sealed form of your zanpakutō? I see. First the execution, and now Bankai. I can see that you enjoy treading on our pride. Very well, then. I will carve into your body...The punishment for injuring our pride!;;;;;;;;
6733;(Bleach);Zangetsu;Though you fight a fierce battle on the outside, your inner world trembles not the slightest.;;;;;;;;
6734;(Bleach);Zangetsu;To fight...Or to live...Choose.;;;;;;;;
6735;(Bleach);Zangetsu;Ichigo... I hate the rain. Rain falls in this world, too. When your heart is in chaos, this sky becomes clouded. When you are sad, rain falls so terribly easy. Can you understand...the horrible feeling of being pelted by rain when you're all alone in this solitary world? If only to stop that rain, I shall lend you any strength. If you trust in me, I won't let a single drop of rain fall from that sky. Ichigo, trust me...you are not fighting alone.;;;;;;;;
6736;(Bleach);Zangetsu;Just how many times must I strain my voice before it will reach you? And yet, nowhere in this world can there be anyone who knows me better than you.;;;;;;;;
6737;(Bleach);Zangetsu;*referring to Ichigo* I see. So I still haven't reached you...;;;;;;;;
6738;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;[When she hops into the bath with Ichigo, but in cat form] What? Are you a little disappointed? Come on, be honest. You are, aren't you? You little pervert!;;;;;;;;
6739;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;That's enough, Soifon. You remind me of myself. I even think of you sometimes as my little sister.;;;;;;;;
6740;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;Kisuke and I used to play here when we were kids. We modeled the one under his shop after this one. It was our own secret playground.;;;;;;;;
6741;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;[thinking after Soifon asks why she didn't take her with her] You've gotten stronger since the last time we were together, Soifon.;;;;;;;;
6742;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;No matter how many times I do this, it results in a wonderful reaction from you, Ichigo!;;;;;;;;
6743;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;It looks to me like you've completely lost your touch.;;;;;;;;
6744;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;Are you sure you don't want to see this smooth skin of a young woman? This will be the last time...;;;;;;;;
6745;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;Do you remember the first time you walked? No. So you weren't conscious of it. Then why did you walk? Everyone was born knowing how to walk. It's called instinct. That's what this boy reminds me of. He knows he can achieve bankai, so he continues.;;;;;;;;
6746;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;In three days, I will make this boy stronger than you.;;;;;;;;
6747;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;It's been a while... Byakuya-bo.;;;;;;;;
6748;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;You shy, little boy.;;;;;;;;
6749;(Bleach);Shihouin Yoruichi;Can't you tell, Aizen? You no longer have a place to run away to.;;;;;;;;
6750;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;Ichigo...We can't...Watch any longer...Eachother's backs...I just can't...I just can't help you out anymore.;;;;;;;;
6751;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;I will defeat him. It may cost my life to do it. However, if I survive, I'll make a promise. The same promise as that time, on the same thing as that time.;;;;;;;;
6752;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;[in reply to Shunsui Kyōraku] It's true, I know nothing about her (Rukia). It might not be quite enough for me to risk my own life over. But...Ichigo wants to save her. That reason is enough for me.;;;;;;;;
6753;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;I don't believe that an absolute power really exists in any world. Power is unstable. It changes constantly. Small differences will always appear, as one has between you and I. So the one who widens that gap will be the winner!;;;;;;;;
6754;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;[to Arrancar Gantenbainne Mosqueda] It seems that my power is more akin to yours than that of a Shinigami or a Quincy.;;;;;;;;
6755;(Bleach);Yasutora Sado;Abuelo... That means grandpa.;;;;;;;;
6756;(Bleach);Kusajishi Yachiru;"[thinking to self about her past, and when she first met Kenpachi] I had no name. I had no parents. I was from District 79, ""Kusajishi"", of the North Alley of Rukongai. I had never seen anything in colors other than the bloody red... Everyone was more beast than human. It wouldn't have been strange to have a baby get stepped on and die. But then you appeared. From District 80, ""Zaraki"", of the North Alley of Rukongai. You appeared to me from even deeper in the darkness. You demolished the chaotic world that was dyed in blood... And then, you gave me a name. If it wasn't for you...I wouldn't be alive today. Yes...Since that day...You've been everything to me in this world.";;;;;;;;
6757;(Bleach);Kusajishi Yachiru;[to Ichigo] Try to stay alive, okay? That way, you and Kenny can play again some day!;;;;;;;;
6758;(Bleach);Kusajishi Yachiru;Ken-Chan!;;;;;;;;
6759;(Bleach);Kusajishi Yachiru;Someone get this creature off meeeeeee!;;;;;;;;
6760;(Death Note);Ryuk;Sorry, but...believe it or not, I'm a male too.;;;;;;;;
6761;(Death Note);Ryuk;Hey, all it did was go around in a full circle.;;;;;;;;
6762;(Death Note);Ryuk;As a rule, they say humans haunted by a shinigami have nothing but misfortune.;;;;;;;;
6763;(Death Note);Ryuk;Apples taste so much better indoors.;;;;;;;;
6764;(Death Note);Ryuk;For me, apples are like cigarettes and liquor for humans. If I'm deprived, I go into withdrawals.;;;;;;;;
6765;(Death Note);Ryuk;That was worth an academy award, Light.;;;;;;;;
6766;(Death Note);Ryuk;I feel like I'm watching a sitcom.;;;;;;;;
6767;(Death Note);Ryuk;Humans are so... interesting.;;;;;;;;
6768;(Death Note);Near;That may be so. What is right from wrong? What is good from evil? Nobody can truly distinguish between them. Even if there was a god. Now, supposing a god and his world existed, even then I'd stop and think for myself. I'd decide for myself whether his teachings are right or wrong. After all, I am just the same as you. I put faith in my own convictions as to what I believe is right, and consider them to be righteous.;;;;;;;;
6769;(Death Note);Near;Seriously, enslavement is funny...;;;;;;;;
6770;(Death Note);Near;I've wanted to make him taste his own pathetic failure with all my heart.;;;;;;;;
6771;(Death Note);Near;Does she understand what she's doing, this stupid woman?;;;;;;;;
6772;(Death Note);Near;For me and Mello, L has been the only person we adore, and the only person who deserves our respect.;;;;;;;;
6773;(Death Note);Near;You said she's smart, but it only means she got high marks, and she's actually a stupid woman.;;;;;;;;
6774;(Death Note);Near;Making such a sleazebag a spokesman...;;;;;;;;
6775;(Death Note);Near;People in supervising positions in investigation are supposed to give too much of their opinion, and if they are wrong, all it would take is an apology.;;;;;;;;
6776;(Death Note);Near;I don't know what to say. Now, I think it's just best to observe closely.;;;;;;;;
6777;(Death Note);Near;"To Mello, it's like playing a videogame against me, I think. ""See who gets to Kira, the last boss, first.""";;;;;;;;
6778;(Death Note);Near;You, who've taken on his name, have managed – well, nothing.;;;;;;;;
6779;(Death Note);Near;It's not whether it's feasible or not – it's what I'm doing.;;;;;;;;
6780;(Death Note);Near;You let them take it from right under your nose.;;;;;;;;
6781;(Death Note);Near;Things are getting interesting now.;;;;;;;;
6782;(Death Note);Near;And that's precisely why it's so convenient, don't you think?;;;;;;;;
6783;(Death Note);Near;I'm pleased to meet you at last, L Number Two.;;;;;;;;
6784;(Death Note);Mello;Near and the others told me that this woman was supposed to be the second Kira. But could it really be this unbelievably stupid girl?..;;;;;;;;
6785;(Death Note);Mello;Matt... I never thought you'd be killed... I'm sorry.;;;;;;;;
6786;(Death Note);Mello;It's my turn to use you.;;;;;;;;
6787;(Death Note);Mello;*to Near* Which of us will get Kira first... it's a race!;;;;;;;;
6788;(Death Note);Mello;I'm not just a tool for you to use in order to solve your puzzles, you know!;;;;;;;;
6789;(Death Note);Mello;So, how about you tell me right now whom you'd like me to kill, and how. I'll treat'cha to it.;;;;;;;;
6790;(Death Note);Mello;He's terribly reasonable, this new L.;;;;;;;;
6791;(Death Note);Mello;In the end, there is no greater motivation than revenge.;;;;;;;;
6792;(Death Note);Mello;It's time I started living my own life.;;;;;;;;
6793;(Death Note);L Lawliet;If you keep my secret, this strawberry is yours.;;;;;;;;
6794;(Death Note);L Lawliet;I haven't said anything about letting them commit murder...yet.;;;;;;;;
6795;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Actually, if you're smart, you can eat sweets without gaining weight.;;;;;;;;
6796;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Risking your life and doing something that could easily rob you of your life are exact opposites.;;;;;;;;
6797;(Death Note);L Lawliet;This isn't divine jugdement. It's the work of some childish killer who's playing at divine retribution. That's all.;;;;;;;;
6798;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Let's show him...that the good guys always win.;;;;;;;;
6799;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Kira is childish and he hates losing... I'm also childish and hate to lose. That's how I know.;;;;;;;;
6800;(Death Note);L Lawliet;Let's value our lives.;;;;;;;;
6801;(Death Note);Light Yagami;It was the only way the world had to be fixed! A purpose, given to me!;;;;;;;;
6802;(Death Note);Light Yagami;This world is still rotten!.. With too many rotten people.;;;;;;;;
6803;(Death Note);Light Yagami;That's right, I am Kira. And what can you do? Kill me right here?;;;;;;;;
6804;(Death Note);Light Yagami;Our battle will be concluded, and I will begin my reign from the summit of victory!;;;;;;;;
6805;(Death Note);Light Yagami;In the end, L is indeed the greatest detective on earth...;;;;;;;;
6806;(Death Note);Light Yagami;"But you know the saying, ""play with fire, and you'll get burned"". I'll make you regret underestimating L...underestimating me.";;;;;;;;
6807;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I must protect my fledging Utopia.;;;;;;;;
6808;(Death Note);Light Yagami;No matter what the world, the god of that world creates the rules. In truth, you have been defeated by the rules I created. And as punishment for defying the God of the new world, you will die...;;;;;;;;
6809;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I've won. Exactly as planned.;;;;;;;;
6810;(Death Note);Light Yagami;For murderers, there is no good or evil. I know that.;;;;;;;;
6811;(Death Note);Light Yagami;The thing I hate the most is to trample on other people's good will.;;;;;;;;
6812;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I've never considered finding that notebook and gaining that power a misfortune.;;;;;;;;
6813;(Death Note);Light Yagami;You can't ever win if you're always on the defensive. To win, you have to attack!;;;;;;;;
6814;(Death Note);Light Yagami;This is the first time in my life that I've been provoked to hit a woman.;;;;;;;;
6815;(Death Note);Light Yagami;L, do you know gods of death love apples?;;;;;;;;
6816;(Death Note);Light Yagami;He was someone who deserved to die.;;;;;;;;
6817;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Orihime] Am I frightening... woman?;;;;;;;;
6818;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Orihime] You're just in time. Watch closely. This is the moment that the man you've put your hope in will lose his life.;;;;;;;;
6819;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;If it is because of what you call a heart, then it is the heart that causes you humans pain. It is because of your heart that you will die.;;;;;;;;
6820;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;Kurosaki Ichigo, those are the words of someone who does not know true despair. So I will show you. This is what true despair looks like.;;;;;;;;
6821;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Ichigo] So you can withstand my Cero even without your mask... You've gotten stronger. Is it because you defeated Grimmjow? Or...Is it because of her? [Motions to Inoue] Or maybe because of your friends, still fighting down below. That girl is already one of us. Even if you manage to rescue her, that won't change. Rescuing her...Is meaningless.;;;;;;;;
6822;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Orihime] Your heart? You humans say that word so lightly. As if it were something one can hold in the palm of one's hand. But my eye sees everything -- Nothing can escape it. What it doesn't see doesn't exist. That's how I've always fought. That's how I've always lived.;;;;;;;;
6823;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Yammy] They're all trash...kill them all.;;;;;;;;
6824;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;Even saying they were just a bunch of fools would suffice. So why can't you? Were it me... I would be angry at the ignorance of those who would enter Hueco Mundo... without even testing their own power.;;;;;;;;
6825;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;It seems I have overestimated you quite a bit. Your evolution did not even satisfy my expectations. This is the end.;;;;;;;;
6826;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;Kurosaki Ichigo, you have no chance of defeating me. Even if you somehow manage to defeat me, there will be three more powerful than myself for you to fight. It doesn't matter if you stand up again a thousand times. The road to victory does not exist.;;;;;;;;
6827;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;I was not capable of stopping it even while using both hands. That surprised me a little. Was that your full power? Well, it seems to be... disappointing.;;;;;;;;
6828;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;And it seems you've acquired a new power. However, is that all you are capable of achieving with it? This is the end. You will no longer interfere. The sun has already set in our hands.;;;;;;;;
6829;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;[To Orihime, when she refuses to eat] Shall I force it down your throat? Or would you rather be strapped down and given IV's?;;;;;;;;
6830;(Bleach);Ulquiorra Schiffer;Therefore let me inform you...All of your dreams are to be thrown away.;;;;;;;;
6831;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;I am calm. That's why I can fight you!;;;;;;;;
6832;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;[to Yammy Rialgo, as the Espada grips the edge of a hole in the floor] Mala Suerte. I pity you. [shoots the floor just before Yammy's hand, causing him to fall] Oh, and I broke the pillars on every floor on the way up. So, you'll probably fall all the way to the bottom.;;;;;;;;
6833;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;[to Renji] I assure you, my gratitude is sincere.;;;;;;;;
6834;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;The right to choose life or death lies with the victor. And the victor of this battle is me.;;;;;;;;
6835;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;Seele Schneider isn't a sword. [strings the weapon on his bow] A Quincy's only weapons...Are bows and arrows. [fires the Seele Schneider];;;;;;;;
6836;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;That's right...If I'm the first one here, I can save Kuchiki-san. Kurosaki must've wanted to rescue her himself...If I did it, he'd get really pissed...Heheheh...;;;;;;;;
6837;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;I hate Shinigami.;;;;;;;;
6838;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;[to Mayuri Kurotsuchi] It's a good thing Orihime isn't here. I wouldn't want her to see what I'm about to do to you.;;;;;;;;
6839;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;[lying about coming to save Rukia] Just passing by. No big deal.... Well, if you must know, I felt a sudden urge to go to Sunflower Seams, that 24-hour dressmaking shop. There's a branch near here. That's where I was headed at this late hour. I certainly didn't bring this bag with me just so I would have an excuse for suddenly leaving the house because I sensed the spirit energy of a shinigami, all right?;;;;;;;;
6840;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;Calling me a coward, eh? At least say it so I can hear it...;;;;;;;;
6841;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;"[to an arrogant projectile-specialist Shinigami] Apparently, on this side, ""ultimate master"" means a windbag with diarrhea of the mouth.";;;;;;;;
6842;(Bleach);Uryuu Ishida;Ah, Kurosaki. I'm glad to see you've finally realized the importance of a cape.;;;;;;;;
6843;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;[to Luppi] Hyourinmaru is the strongest of all ice-type Zanpakutoes. Your weapon may have eight arms, but mine is all the water in the atmosphere! Sennen Hyourou!! [causes several pillars of ice to form, before using them to crush Luppi] Sorry. Eight wasn't enough.;;;;;;;;
6844;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;I didn't come here to fight! I came here to hack at you violently!;;;;;;;;
6845;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;We are all like fireworks. We climb, shine, and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even if that time comes, let's not disappear like a firework. Let's continue to shine... Forever.;;;;;;;;
6846;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;Stand back? [To Kira after Gin asked him to stand back] No, Kira...Run. Run until you're out of my sight, and keep running. Otherwise...I can't guarantee you won't get dragged into this and be killed.;;;;;;;;
6847;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;I'M﻿ NOT AN ELEMENTARY STUDENT!!!;;;;;;;;
6848;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;Aizen, I will kill you.;;;;;;;;
6849;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;"Don't come back... ""Bed-wetter"" Momo.";;;;;;;;
6850;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;Dummy. I'm not gonna dwell on what happened forever. All that junk... it's the furthest thing on my mind. You should especially quit worrying about it and get some more sleep. Hurry up and get rid of your Panda eyes, got it?;;;;;;;;
6851;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;No, not yet, now that you've made me this serious. Regret as much as you damn well want!!;;;;;;;;
6852;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;[to Gin Ichimaru] If you make Hinamori shed even one drop of blood, I'll kill you.;;;;;;;;
6853;(Bleach);Toushirou Hitsugaya;Sit upon the frozen heavens! Hyōrinmaru!!;;;;;;;;
6854;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Seek not beauty in battle. Seek not beauty in death. Consider not your own life. If you wish to protect that which must be protected, then strike while your opponent's back is turned.;;;;;;;;
6855;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;All creatures want to believe in something bigger than themselves. They cannot live without blind obedience. And to escape the pressure of that trust, those in whom faith is placed in turn look for someone higher than themselves. And then those people in turn look for someone even stronger. That is how all Kings are born. That is how all Gods are born.;;;;;;;;
6856;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Trusting someone...means relying on them and only the weak do that.;;;;;;;;
6857;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;I never ask them to trust me at all. I told them to come with me but I never told them to trust me. And I always tell them not to trust anyone, including myself. But sadly, there are not many strong enough to do that.;;;;;;;;
6858;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;[To Barragan, before he was recruited by Aizen] Isn't it ironic, king of Hueco Mundo? Dressed in black and poised to attack, you look just like a shinigami.;;;;;;;;
6859;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;[To Orihime, after she had being taken from Ichigo once again] A girl like you should smile more often. Overcast skies blot out the sun, and that always brings people's spirits down. So why not let the sun shine...For just a while longer?;;;;;;;;
6860;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;No matter what may happen... As long as you walk by my side... There shall be no enemy that can stand before us.;;;;;;;;
6861;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Good evening, Espada. There has been an enemy attack. But first...Let us brew some tea.;;;;;;;;
6862;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;[After Gin offers to kill some Arrancars] No thanks, for that would be boring.;;;;;;;;
6863;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Oh? I thought I severed your body from the waist-down, but...It seems the cut was too shallow.;;;;;;;;
6864;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;In my eyes, there is no difference between wiping away one speck of dust or two.;;;;;;;;
6865;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;"""No longer the Aizen you know,"" hm...? I'm afraid you've been deluded, Abarai-kun...The 'Aizen Sousuke' you knew never existed to begin with.";;;;;;;;
6866;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;It's very difficult for me to step on an ant without crushing it.;;;;;;;;
6867;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Don't use such strong words -- It makes your weakness all the more apparent.;;;;;;;;
6868;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;I had no intention of deceiving anyone. It's just that none of you could understand...My true self.;;;;;;;;
6869;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;[To Hitsugaya, after stabbing Hinamori] Aww...You found her. Sorry, I didn't want you to find out this way...No. I should have chopped her into little pieces and hidden them away where you would never find them.;;;;;;;;
6870;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;I've liked him for so long. So long. But Mayama likes someone else. But I wanna hear his voice. I want to hold his hand. I feel like this.;;;;;;;;
6871;(Honey and Clover);Ayumi Yamada;Never once did I say it.  But just as he knew my feelings and couldn't return them. She will probably realize his and probably his heart wouldn't have a chance either? When I think about things like that, my tears won't stop.;;;;;;;;
6872;(Bleach);Soi Fon;I'll show you a real assassination. No... Maybe you won't even be able to see it.;;;;;;;;
6873;(Bleach);Soi Fon;I thought I told you. If you see your allies losing, that's your chance. Don't step between them. Take the enemy down from behind. And if the enemy's so strong, you can't even do that, then just watch your allies get killed. That's what it means to be Special Forces.;;;;;;;;
6874;(Bleach);Soi Fon;Of my five older siblings, two died on the first mission, then two more on the second. Then on the sixth mission, the last one... Died as well. I felt sad, somewhat, but more than that, I felt ashamed of their incompetence.;;;;;;;;
6875;(Bleach);Soi Fon;I'm inadequate in everything.;;;;;;;;
6876;(Bleach);Soi Fon;Such words are wasted on someone like me.;;;;;;;;
6877;(Bleach);Soi Fon;Showing your back in a battle? You've become a fool Yoruichi!;;;;;;;;
6878;(Bleach);Soi Fon;You know the power of my zanpakuto, Suzumebachi. If someone gets hit twice in the same spot... They die!;;;;;;;;
6879;(Bleach);Soi Fon;The one hundred years we were apart were meant to bring me power and make you weak! Yoruichi!;;;;;;;;
6880;(Bleach);Soi Fon;Why didn't you take me with you!? Yoruichi?;;;;;;;;
6881;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Only underlings get caught up in the matter of style and lose the battle. A captain can't afford such indulgences. Don't try to be a good kid. Whether you own somebody or they own you. The moment you start a fight, you are wrong in either way.;;;;;;;;
6882;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;[To Starrk, about Lilynette] That child with you... Can you send her somewhere else? I can't really go all out with her there.;;;;;;;;
6883;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Why so cold, Nanao-chan?;;;;;;;;
6884;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Do we really have to fight, Yama-jii?;;;;;;;;
6885;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;I placed this blade of grass in my mouth thinking I'd look cool. But it must be poison 'cause ith makinth ma mouth numb.;;;;;;;;
6886;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Cute, cute Nanao-chaaaan. Lovely, lovely Nanao -- AHHHHHHH!!!!;;;;;;;;
6887;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Nanao-chan is last place!;;;;;;;;
6888;(Bleach);Shunsui Kyōraku;Flowers are disturbed, god of flowers weeps, winds of Heaven are disturbed, demon of Heaven laughs. Katen Kyōkotsu!;;;;;;;;
6889;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;I was glad you did not pretend to be a saint and claim to love the world despite everything. That is why I decided that I would be your true friend. I would accept your sorrow. And I would share my joy. If you strayed I would reprimand you. If you made mistakes, I would forgive you. And when you found yourself in trouble, I would be there for you. So that you who learn to hate the world, would come to love it once more.;;;;;;;;
6890;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;"Back then. I felt a kernel of untruth in your words. You talked about ""The world she loves"" many times. But made not a single mention of ""The world I love"".";;;;;;;;
6891;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;You destroyed those Menos Grandes. That's enough for me! I have decided to fight by your side! I won't accept no as an answer, masked ones!;;;;;;;;
6892;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;You are right. I have not yet introduced myself. I am Captain of the Seventh Division Komamura Sajin. And though it shames me, I am just as you say -- A meager worm of a man.;;;;;;;;
6893;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;[to Choe Neng Poww, as the giant Arrancar charges a Cero after making a comment on Komamura's strength] I see...Then I shall stop that yawn in its tracks. Bankai.;;;;;;;;
6894;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;Don't retreat, Tetsuzaemon. No matter what. You stand firm right behind me!;;;;;;;;
6895;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;[thinking at the grave of Tosen's friend] O' anonymous friend of Tousen... If you had been there...What would you have said to stop him?;;;;;;;;
6896;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;Let us commence, Zaraki! Your favorite game of carnage!!;;;;;;;;
6897;(Bleach);Komamura Sajin;[during Tosen, Gin Ichimaru and Sosuke Aizen's escape from Soul Society] Get down here, Tosen! Why did you become a Shingami? Was it not for your deceased friend? Was it not to carry out justice!? Where is your justice now!?;;;;;;;;
6898;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;[holds up juice box] How do you drink from this?;;;;;;;;
6899;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;You can see me? Rather, you kicked me...;;;;;;;;
6900;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;I see. I feel a strong pulse.;;;;;;;;
6901;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;Have you been out on the window ledge all this time, in plain sight? What if the neighbors report a silver haired elementary student burglar?;;;;;;;;
6902;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;I already told you...you can't kill me with that sword anymore!;;;;;;;;
6903;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;If you wanna talk to me, do it while I cut you to pieces. But, I'm not gonna hold back one bit! Bankai!;;;;;;;;
6904;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;Don't just blame yourself. You're not tough enough to withstand everything. Split the load, to my shoulders, and to Ichigo's. Just stack it little by little. That's why we've become stronger. Believe in him, Rukia.;;;;;;;;
6905;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;I've always been afraid...Always been pretending to follow you closely, always pretending to sharpen my fangs, when the truth is...I'm scared to death just treading on your shadow.;;;;;;;;
6906;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;I shall light a fire upon the fang that falls short, so that I needn't see that star...So that it shall not tear this throat of mine.;;;;;;;;
6907;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;Ichigo...I know this is shameful, but I'm begging you -- Rukia...Please save Rukia!!;;;;;;;;
6908;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;The stray dog in me is dyed into my bones... All I do is howl at the moon, but I don't have the guts to bite...;;;;;;;;
6909;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;Howl, Zabimaru.;;;;;;;;
6910;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;I knew it. You can't even ask your own zanpakutō its name.;;;;;;;;
6911;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;You're just an overnight shinigami. You couldn't put one scratch on us real ones.;;;;;;;;
6912;(Bleach);Abarai Renji;*to Ichigo* So you're the human who got his powers from Rukia?;;;;;;;;
6913;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;I'll tattle-tale to Yachiru if you keep that up, Ikkaku!;;;;;;;;
6914;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;"I don't know if you noticed, but you just called him ""Captain.""";;;;;;;;
6915;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;I hate talkative guys... They gross me out.;;;;;;;;
6916;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;Growl, Haineko!;;;;;;;;
6917;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;[Rangiku steps out of the bath naked to comfort a crying Orihime] There, there! Cry, cry, you poor thing. Drown all of your sorrows in my chest!;;;;;;;;
6918;(Bleach);Matsumoto Rangiku;[to Momo on Aizen's final letter] As a vice-captain, I think it's a great honor to be the receiver of her captain's final words. Read it well.;;;;;;;;
6919;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;[thinking as Nel tells her to cheer for Ichigo] That's right. To begin with, I came here just thinking I wanted to protect everyone. But when I heard they had come to save me, I couldn't help but feel a little glad, just a bit in my heart. When I look at Kurosaki-kun in that mask, I think that he might not have come here to save me at all. Even though it's wrong, they shouldn't be going that far for me.;;;;;;;;
6920;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;Kurosaki-kun... I'm weak, so it's always like I turn back to look to you for help. But now I won't turn back and I'll go forward. The next time we meet I won't look to you for help, Kurosaki-kun, I'll be able to fight on my own.;;;;;;;;
6921;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;We don't look any different from those shinigami. We just dress diferently.;;;;;;;;
6922;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;It's just that... It's just that not being able to fight with everyone makes me feel lonely...!! But what would make me feel worse than being lonely is getting in everyone's way... that would make me feel worse!! If it means getting in the way of Kurosaki-kun and everyone... then I would rather be lonely, very lonely.;;;;;;;;
6923;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;"I'm a terrible person, aren't I? ""If only Kurosaki-kun would cheer up, I'd be happy."" At least, I thought that was how I felt. Then Kuchiki-san came back and cheered Kurosaki-kun up. I should have been really happy, but... but... [starts to cry] but instead I'm jealous of Kuchiki-san!";;;;;;;;
6924;(Bleach);Inoue Orihime;If I were the rain, that binds together the heavens and the earth, whom in all eternity will never mingle, would I be able to bind two hearts together?;;;;;;;;
6925;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;[to Nemu about Uryuu. Nemu is currently attempting to restrain Uryuu so Mayruri can heal him, but she is unknowingly smothering him with her breasts] Yes, Nemu. Just smother him with those things. Worst case, he dies happy.;;;;;;;;
6926;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;[to Szayel Aporro Grantz] Immaculate being... Was it? In this secular existence, perfection is an illusion, regardless of those who utter the contrary. This is the reality. Common man seeks it out, they strive to achieve it, as if it were some tangible thing... But... The fact of the matter is, perfection is a hollow shell. It is devoid of any substance. I spit on perfection. Perfection, after all, implies you've reached the summit. No trial and error, no ability to conceptualize. An omniscient being would have no need for such superfluous things... Am I making myself clear? For people who dabble in the sciences, such as ourselves, perfection would make us obsolete. Many magnificent things have been, and will continue to come into existence... And yet every last one of them will fall short of perfection's finish. Our function as men of science relies on their many shortcomings. Then, and only then, can we apply the fruits of our labor. To put it simply... As soon as you began spouting that nonsense about being an immaculate being... your fate was sealed. How dare you call yourself a man of science?;;;;;;;;
6927;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;[upon arriving at Szayel Aporro Grantz's location] Arrancar, Arrancar, Arrancar... Espada! Hueco Mundo is quite the treasure trove.;;;;;;;;
6928;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;Oh, you know what I'm talking about. That stupid line that all you Quincies keep saying up until the moment you die. By the honor of the Quincy I cannot do this, by the honor of the Quincy I won't allow that. Quincy this, Quincy that! Every last one of you! It's so annoying!;;;;;;;;
6929;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;Killing you now will be as easy as strangling a baby.;;;;;;;;
6930;(Bleach);Kurotsuchi Mayuri;A grenade that's thrown should not come back.;;;;;;;;
6931;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;[to Chad and Orihime] Your transformation is not a disease. You were just given the key to the door in front of you. There's no need to know the cause. No need for sorrow or sadness. What comes next is up to you. You can use your keys to open the door...or lock it tight. And if you do choose to open it... You can still decide not to pass through.;;;;;;;;
6932;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;Awaken, Benihime.;;;;;;;;
6933;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;[Singing to Yammy] Aizen-sama will get maaaad at youuuu!;;;;;;;;
6934;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;Oh, it IS a chore. Risking your life and keeping busy are all the same!;;;;;;;;
6935;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;Noooo, there's no way I, a mere handsome and sexy shopkeeper, could possibly have bankai!;;;;;;;;
6936;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;[To Yoruichi] It's alright! Kurosaki-san's potential is greater than mine!;;;;;;;;
6937;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;[Sees Yoruichi in cat form] Yes! It's Yoruichi! You've come back! Ha ha ha!! [Picks her up] Come here you little devil, let me take a look at you! You're my fuzzy little troublemaker, yes you are! Now who's your daddy? Hmm?;;;;;;;;
6938;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;I'll drive you into a corner and make you remember that attack.;;;;;;;;
6939;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;[Urahara writes Ichigo a message in blood] Please meet at Urahara shop immediately. [After Ichigo freaked out] P.S: If you look at this message and think that it is the message of a person before his death... then you have no sense of humor.;;;;;;;;
6940;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;A warrior who has lost his ability to fight is only going to be in the way.;;;;;;;;
6941;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;Lately, I've been looking at these two guys only. As expected, I see flowers when there are women in the workplace... the atmosphere!;;;;;;;;
6942;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[In his Resurrección form] I can see! I can see! I can see!!! So this is the sky!! So this is blood!! So this is the world!! ...So this is what you look like. Komamura. You are uglier... than I thought.;;;;;;;;
6943;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[to Hisagi after stabbing him] I am afraid. Then and now, my fear has always been that I would die a shinigami like you.;;;;;;;;
6944;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[to Komamura] Don't make me laugh. Aizen-sama has given me something far more powerful than a bankai.;;;;;;;;
6945;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[to Hisagi] Open my eyes? You? Open my eyes? You never change.;;;;;;;;
6946;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[after Hisagi thanks him] Aren't you clever? Is that supposed to be sarcastic?;;;;;;;;
6947;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;I knew it would. Someday we would cross swords and one of us will die.;;;;;;;;
6948;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;It must make you sick to know an underling like me is going to kill you.;;;;;;;;
6949;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;I was trying to chop off your head from the eye up. A little scratch counts as a miss.;;;;;;;;
6950;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;Justice without a great cause begets nothing more than slaughter. That same slaughter in a great cause...Is Justice.;;;;;;;;
6951;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;I told you before, Komamura. The only paths that I see with these eyes are the ones not dyed with blood. Those paths are the paths to justice. So whichever path I choose...Is justice.;;;;;;;;
6952;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;If it's not enough to believe in justice, then I will become justice. I will seek out all evil in this world and wipe them out like the clouds in the sky. I swear I will...For justice.;;;;;;;;
6953;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[about his deceased friend] I never overcame my shyness and told her that I actually liked clouds.;;;;;;;;
6954;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[to Kenpachi Zaraki, after Tosen's senses-robbing Bankai still does not discourage the Eleventh Division Captain from fighting] I see. It's understandable. You are a demon. You belong in the darkness. So of course you do not fear it.;;;;;;;;
6955;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;I do not hate you. However, to protect our peaceful existence, there is no other way!;;;;;;;;
6956;(Bleach);Tousen Kaname;[to Kenpachi Zaraki] I did not say that I hate you. What I mean to say is that you are unforgivable!!;;;;;;;;
6957;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;When we die, our bodies disintegrate and become part of the reishi that make up Soul Society. And when that time comes...where does your heart go? It gets passed on to your nakama (comrades). If you pass it on to them, then your heart will always live on within them. Kuchiki, that's why...you must never, ever, ever die alone. Got it, Kuchiki?;;;;;;;;
6958;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;Whenever you fight from this point on, there is one thing you must never do. Which is...to die alone.;;;;;;;;
6959;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;"Every time you and I interact...a bit of ""heart"" is born between us. Heart isn't something inside you. But whenever you think, whenever you remember someone, that's when heart is born. I mean, if you were the only one alive in the whole world, heart wouldn't exist, now would it?";;;;;;;;
6960;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;The fight to protect life and the fight to protect honor——that's Captain Ukitake's policy. But you know, Kuchiki...I think that in the end, those both end up being the same thing. ...Heart.;;;;;;;;
6961;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;"[when Rukia asks why she is in the Gotei 13] What the hell?! That's so obvious! To ""fight"" and to ""protect""!";;;;;;;;
6962;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;[dying] Kuchiki, I dragged you into this...I'm sorry. You must've been scared. Thanks, Kuchiki. Thanks to you...I can leave my heart here.;;;;;;;;
6963;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;[possessed by a Hollow] Why do you keep calling my name so? Are you that worried about me? Are you that much in love with me, little girl? If you love me so much...I'll eat you first!;;;;;;;;
6964;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;Uncoil the seas and heavens, Nejibana!;;;;;;;;
6965;(Bleach);Shiba Kaien;But don't forget... as long as you're in my division, I'm on your side until death and beyond.;;;;;;;;
6966;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;The Commander-General's rather violent today, wouldn't you say?;;;;;;;;
6967;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;If you were in this situation, what would you have done? You would run after Byakuya...And then kick him in the butt, right? No matter how one captain complains, the Central Government won't change their decision for one person. But if it was you, you would still run around appealing to save Kuchiki...No. You would probably do something completely different. You always chose the path that lead to the most danger. Am I right...Kaien?;;;;;;;;
6968;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;My, my. So dangerous.;;;;;;;;
6969;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;If you save Kaien, then what becomes of his pride? If you go to his aid now, his life will be saved. But... at the same time, it would end up killing his pride for all eternity.;;;;;;;;
6970;(Bleach);Ukitake Jyuushirou;All waves, rise now and become my shield, lightning, strike now and become my blade! Sōgyo no Kotowari!;;;;;;;;
6971;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;You may be able to save us. If you stay and protect us. But what's good is that everyone else dies! Please go!! Captain Komamura!!!;;;;;;;;
6972;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;"It increases the weight of whatever it hits, until my opponent can no longer bear the weight and falls to the ground. And then they bow their head as if in apology. That's why it's called ""Wabisuke"".";;;;;;;;
6973;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;War is not heroic. War is not exhilarating. War is full of despair. It's dark. It's dreadful. It's a thing of sorrow and gloom.;;;;;;;;
6974;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;Farewell, warrior of the sky. I pray... you don't forgive me.;;;;;;;;
6975;(Bleach);Kira Izuru;Raise your head, Wabisuke.;;;;;;;;
6976;(Bleach);Madarame Ikkaku;[in reference to Mizuho Asano, Keigo's sister] I owe this crazy woman.;;;;;;;;
6977;(Bleach);Madarame Ikkaku;You can't carry me AND dodge at the same time, Tetsuzaemon!;;;;;;;;
6978;(Bleach);Madarame Ikkaku;Awww maaan, and I really didn't feel like using it this early either. Better watch closely, and make sure you don't tell a soul! Bankai!!;;;;;;;;
6979;(Bleach);Madarame Ikkaku;Well, you sure have weird ways of doing things. The one who taught me how to give your name out to he whom you are about to kill also said... that it was always the last lesson he taught his students. That way, if you do end a person's life... at the very least, they will know the name of the one who slashed their mortal coil. I'm of the 11th Division, 3rd seat, Madarame Ikkaku! You're right, there's no reason for me to hear your name, because the most important thing is that you know mine. After all, it is the name of the man... who will send you to your death!;;;;;;;;
6980;(Bleach);Madarame Ikkaku;I got no intentions of becoming a captain. Becoming a captain would mean that I can't fight under Captain Zaraki. If your wish is to surpass Kuchiki Byakuya... then I just have one wish: to fight and die under that man's command. That's all.;;;;;;;;
6981;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;Live well, Ichigo. Live well, age well, go bald well, and die after me. And... if you can, die smiling.;;;;;;;;
6982;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;I didn't hate it as much as I said. That hollow, that is. If there's anything that I've truly hated for 20 years without thinking twice... it'd have to be the fact that I failed to save Masaki on that night.;;;;;;;;
6983;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;It's one of the basics... So I will teach you. A shinigami at the rank of Captain can control the size of his zanpakuto got it? Otherwise everyone'd carry around ginormous swords... just like you. Remember this well. You can't fathom the power of your rival simply from the size of his zanpakuto. You shouldn't give lectures about Shinigami until you understand that.;;;;;;;;
6984;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;[to Yuzu] Ah! It's okay, Yuzu, don't cry! Daddy will show you something really hilarious!;;;;;;;;
6985;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;[to Karin] Do as your heart desires! Jump into your father's bosom!;;;;;;;;
6986;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;It's not anyone's fault that Masaki died. It's just that... the woman I fell in love with... was a woman who could die protecting her son. And don't forget. You are the guy... the woman I loved gave her life to protect.;;;;;;;;
6987;(Bleach);Kurosaki Isshin;GOOD MOOOORNING ICHIGOOOOOO!!!!;;;;;;;;
6988;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;We can't waste time worrying about the what-if's. Rukia's execution date has been changed to noon tomorrow. So what? If the deadline has been changed to tomorrow... I'll just have to finish today!;;;;;;;;
6989;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;The moment I came out of that hole was the moment your luck ran out!;;;;;;;;
6990;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;I see. So basically, you're a shinigami? And you came all the way from some place called Soul Society to vanquish evil spirits? Which means that monster earlier was one of those evil spirits? And it attacked that little girl? Okay, I belie- NO WAY I'LL BELIEVE THAT, DUMBASS!;;;;;;;;
6991;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;Dammit, is that how you greet your son who went out of his way to help a ghost on the way home?!;;;;;;;;
6992;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[about his Hollow group prior to them becoming Arancar as he eats pieces of them] You sicken me. You're all just a bunch of bloody cowards. Alright, I'll eat all of you. You'll see how it feels on the next level, as a part of my own flesh. I am... I am the king!;;;;;;;;
6993;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[To Orihime] I've repaid my debt to you. Now, you're gonna accompany me on a little errand.;;;;;;;;
6994;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[to Ichigo] I don't care if you're a human, a Soul Reaper or even a Hollow! I'll crush anybody who looks down on me! And you, Kurosaki, will be the first to go!;;;;;;;;
6995;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[to Ichigo] You're a Soul Reaper and I'm a Hollow. Whichever side loses will be massacred! It's been that way for over a thousand years! Who needs any more reason than that?! Now bring it! The last man standing gets to go home alive! That's all there is to it!;;;;;;;;
6996;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[about Ulquiorra Cifer, after he takes out Ichigo] I'll teach him what happens when you steal someone else's prey.;;;;;;;;
6997;(Bleach);Grimmjow Jeagerjaques;[to Ichigo] Don't forget my name, Soul Reaper, and you better pray that you never hear it again! Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez...because the next time you hear my name, you'll be a dead man...I promise.;;;;;;;;
6998;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;[as a child, to Rangiku Matsumoto] I've decided. I'm going to become a Shinigami. Become a Shinigami and change things. So that they'll end...without Rangiku having to cry.;;;;;;;;
6999;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;Emotions? Nope, I've got nothin' like that. I told you when we first met, didn't I? I'm a snake. With cold skin, no emotions, that slithers around searching for prey with its tongue, swallowing down whatever looks tasty.;;;;;;;;
7000;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;[Talking about Hueco Mundo] There isn't even water! Huh? Then how'd we have tea earlier?;;;;;;;;
7001;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;[Referring to Tosen] He's such a boy scout, wouldn't you agree?;;;;;;;;
7002;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;Oops. They found us.;;;;;;;;
7003;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;[To Rukia as she is taken to Sokyoku Hill] Bye Bye, Rukia chan! See 'ya at the execution grounds.;;;;;;;;
7004;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;If you pull your sword in a place like this, I'll just have to stop you, won't I?;;;;;;;;
7005;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;Sorry, Aizen-sama. I got caught.;;;;;;;;
7006;(Bleach);Ichimaru Gin;A gatekeeper ain't supposed to open gates.;;;;;;;;
7007;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;No matter how strong a defense, a stronger offense will always shatter it.;;;;;;;;
7008;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;"""Control""... you say? When you stand before me... that word holds no meaning. Bankai. Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.";;;;;;;;
7009;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Exactly when did I say that I do this because I am a shinigami? My killing you is no other reason than the fact that you... Pointed your blade [view shifts to Rukia] at my pride.;;;;;;;;
7010;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;The arrogant one is you, Espada. But rest at ease. The reason for your loss is not due to that arrogance. It is simply due to a difference in power.;;;;;;;;
7011;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;You and I...our levels are as distant as the earth from the heavens. ...Must I spell it out for you? I have discarded my left arm, discarded my left leg, and yet even then I have not nearly lowered myself to your level.;;;;;;;;
7012;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;It is a thousand years too early... for you to become worthy enough to die by my Bankai.;;;;;;;;
7013;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Well done. That time, your fang definitely touched me.;;;;;;;;
7014;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Be proud as someone who, after being struck by this power, is still able to retain the shape of a body.;;;;;;;;
7015;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Your blade will never be able to touch me. Ever.;;;;;;;;
7016;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Put away your sword and you shall live...unless you're still dreaming about defeating me. Did you forget, or did it just never occur to you...that I have Bankai as well?;;;;;;;;
7017;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;The curtain that falls at the end...shall be pulled down by the blade of my sword.;;;;;;;;
7018;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;That's not possible. With your ability, you couldn't even make one of my knees touch the ground.;;;;;;;;
7019;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;The Kuchiki clan is one of the four noble houses. We must set the standard for all shinigami. If we do not abide by the code...then who will uphold it?;;;;;;;;
7020;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;No choice, then. Before you become intoxicated by your own power, I shall show you a decisive power gap that you could not overcome in a millennium of struggle.;;;;;;;;
7021;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Are you telling me to exploit an opening for the likes of you? Do not speak out of your league, boy.;;;;;;;;
7022;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Disappear. My sword does not exist to crush insects like you.;;;;;;;;
7023;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;Scatter, Senbonzakura.;;;;;;;;
7024;(Bleach);Kuchiki Byakuya;You're slow, even when you're falling.;;;;;;;;
7025;(Gintama);Kagura;Gin-chan told me to pay people back double for revenge!;;;;;;;;
7026;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Shinpachi, just remember this... We aren't friends with justice or even your sister. We're YOUR friends.;;;;;;;;
7027;(Gintama);Sarutobi Ayame;Gin-san, aren't you gonna make fun of me? Are you just gonna ignore me?!;;;;;;;;
7028;(Gintama);Sarutobi Ayame;I watch over Gin-san to protect him. Just like a fairy, like Tinkerbell!;;;;;;;;
7029;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;*about Katsura, who apparently got his head hit very hard* Forget his name, this guy's questioning his own existence!;;;;;;;;
7030;(Gintama);Hijikata Toushirou;*while eating Super Spicy Senbei* It's spicy... It's spicy. Damn it, why am I... It's so spicy I have tears in my eyes.;;;;;;;;
7031;(Gintama);Hijikata Toushirou;I just...    ...want to make the woman I love happy.;;;;;;;;
7032;(Gintama);Isao Kondō;*to Okita* I don't care about that gap you created on your own. I'll jump across it as many times as it takes, and punch some sense into you.;;;;;;;;
7033;(Gintama);Isao Kondō;If someone went the wrong way, the other two would beat him up until he got back on track. That's how it always been. That's why we'll always stay on the right path!;;;;;;;;
7034;(Gintama);Okita Sougo;*talking about Shinsengumi* Every time I'm with all of you, there's always a gap. I'm different from all of you.;;;;;;;;
7035;(Wolf's Rain);Kiba;I smelled something: The scent of a Lunar Flower. It was coming from this city.;;;;;;;;
7036;(Wolf's Rain);Hige;[talking to Kiba, who is being held in a cage] Man, you really screwed up. I mean, I've seen one of us get hurt before, but never this badly. And you're caught, too.;;;;;;;;
7037;(Wolf's Rain);Tsume;[to Toboe] I wanted to take you to paradise.;;;;;;;;
7038;(Wolf's Rain);Tsume;I finished Hige off. I don't want to move any more either. I knew it from the beginning, I knew it somewhere in my heart. That's why I led a spontaneous life. I was confident after having met you... that I wasn't the one who would open Paradise. [groans];;;;;;;;
7039;(Wolf's Rain);Hige;[tsume bites into his neck] Let's meet up again in Paradise.;;;;;;;;
7040;(Wolf's Rain);Hige;Can you do me a favor? Could you kill me with your fangs? Can you still not forgive me? Am I still a traitor?;;;;;;;;
7041;(Wolf's Rain);Hige;That hot dog must've fried your brain!;;;;;;;;
7042;(Wolf's Rain);Kiba;*to Hige* Coming from you, that sounds kind of fishy.;;;;;;;;
7043;(Wolf's Rain);Cheza;We would not have met, and the flowers will protect you. Kiba, because you protected this one, the flowers will return and bloom once more. So when the world is reborn, and Paradise opens, we will meet again. This one will be waiting for you. Find this one. And this time, the Paradise you hoped for will be...;;;;;;;;
7044;(Wolf's Rain);Kiba;"They say there's no such place... as Paradise. Even if you search to the ends of the Earth, there's nothing there. No matter how far you walk, it's always the same road. It just goes on and on. But, in spite of that... Why am I so driven to find it? A voice calls to me... It says, ""Search for Paradise.""";;;;;;;;
7045;(Wolf's Rain);Kiba;Why? Why do humans always look to the sky? Why do you try so hard to fly when you don't have any wings? We'll run on our own legs.;;;;;;;;
7046;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;I hate sweets.;;;;;;;;
7047;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Even if my left arm can transform into a monstrous claw and can destroy Akuma, im just a normal person with a promise...;;;;;;;;
7048;(Gintama);Hijikata Toushirou;Inside your mouth, it's rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, wonderful.;;;;;;;;
7049;(Prince Of Tennis);Ryoma Echizen;I don't like lectures from someone who plays fixed matches.;;;;;;;;
7050;(Lucky Star);Konata Izumi;As time goes by without anyone eating it, it starts getting dry and looking anything but appetizing, and no one's willing to make a move, but when the busboy takes it you go 'wait, we're not done with that yet.' kinda on reflex. But then you end up leaving without eating it.;;;;;;;;
7051;(Lucky Star);Kagami Hiiragi;Can you stop guessing if they got the question right based on the amount of time left when they cut to commercial!?;;;;;;;;
7052;(Gintama);Okita Sougo;Hijikata-san. I forgot my flute at the headquarters, so I'm gonna go back and get it real quick.;;;;;;;;
7053;(Junjou Romantica);Hiroki Kamijou;Is there a limit to how much you can love somebody? No matter how much I hurt him or get hurt by him, I find myself far from hating him, actually hoping that those wounds will scar, like burns...because then you can never forget me.;;;;;;;;
7054;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;What is it, you? Bang bang banging on people's heads like that. Are you hoping to become a tambourine player? If you don't like Shin-chan, then how about Sen-chan from secret operation?;;;;;;;;
7055;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;He won't play up to anyone. He won't be led astray by anything. He simply places himself in a clear space.;;;;;;;;
7056;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;To me, the world is not only the shape on the map. On the battle field, all I see are the faces of the order and my friends... I am an awful person aren't I? Instead of the real world, all I care about is my friends. That's because they are my whole world... Even if just one of my friends dies, to me, it's the same thing as part of the world being destroyed.;;;;;;;;
7057;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;The best way to live a full life is to be a child, no matter your age.;;;;;;;;
7058;(Gintama);Kagura;I'm not eating early. In my country, we always ate hot dogs during class.;;;;;;;;
7059;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Do you really intend to lose even more of your friends for something like that? I'll pass on that. As long as I'm alive, I'll live by my own rules. I'll live as I see fit and protect that which I hold dear.;;;;;;;;
7060;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Katsura, just stop this. No matter how elegant you think dying is, your death won't appease your conscience and won't change anything.;;;;;;;;
7061;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Shut up you! What's with that TV drama attitude?!;;;;;;;;
7062;(Gintama);Kotarō Katsura;We could drive them off the entire earth if we had your strength, Gintoki!;;;;;;;;
7063;(Death Note);L Lawliet;No matter how gifted you are... You, alone, cannot change the world.;;;;;;;;
7064;(Death Note);L Lawliet;If I sit like a normal person my investigative abilities are only working at 50% efficiency.;;;;;;;;
7065;(Death Note);Light Yagami;I am Justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil. I'm the one that will become the god of a new world that every one desires!;;;;;;;;
7066;(Getbackers);Midou Ban;Humans are things that don't know the true value of something precious until they lose it...and if somehow, they get that precious thing back, they'll forget its value again.;;;;;;;;
7067;(Kaze no Stigma);Kazuma Yagami;I'll always be by your side, just like the wind that flows through your hair.;;;;;;;;
7068;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;Unless I grip the sword, I cannot protect you. While gripping the sword, I cannot embrace you.;;;;;;;;
7069;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Syaoran Li;Though we had to part, though we could never be together again. We had no regrets. Even if she returned to her world, married another man and had children with him. If the woman I loved was happy, then I could be happy. And I am. Our hearts had joined and so, even if she lived in a different world, that time, we really were together always, always. I would never let go of this feeling, or my love for her.;;;;;;;;
7070;(Inuyasha);Inuyasha;Heh, I guess somehow without me knowing, it just feels so natural now, to have Kagome by my side.;;;;;;;;
7071;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Sebastian, you know what to do.;;;;;;;;
7072;(Kuroshitsuji);Elizabeth Middleford;Ciel, how are you?;;;;;;;;
7073;(Gintama);Kotarō Katsura;Gintoki, will you take up your sword once again to cleanse this rotting nation? Lend me the strength of the fearsome white demon once again. [flashback to when they were fighting together] Is this it? Rather than falling into enemy hands, we should kill ourselves and die as warriors.;;;;;;;;
7074;(Gintama);Kagura;I'm on TV! I gotta call my folks!;;;;;;;;
7075;(Gintama);Hijikata Toushirou;*to Okita, who tells him that he should take his job more seriously* Shall I put you to sleep, ingrate?;;;;;;;;
7076;(Gintama);Okita Sougo;You mean that we failed again to prevent a bombing? What are you doing, Hijikata-san? You should take this job more seriously.;;;;;;;;
7077;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;It might be dog food. Take it.;;;;;;;;
7078;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;*talking about a nosebleed* And why would a girl your age pick hard enough to get a nosebleed?!;;;;;;;;
7079;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;We've got nothing left at home but salt and sugar.;;;;;;;;
7080;(Gintama);Shimura Shinpachi;[Shinpachi and Kagura are stuck in a trashcan, and have been pushed onto the train tracks. Shinpachi sees a train coming]This timing's just like some manga!;;;;;;;;
7081;(Gintama);Kagura;I don't like men with glasses.;;;;;;;;
7082;(Gintama);Shimura Shinpachi;Who the hell are they? Pedophile yakuza?;;;;;;;;
7083;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;In this country, we don't call someone who can stop a scooter with her bare hands a girl. We call her a mountain gorilla.;;;;;;;;
7084;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;[after hitting Kagura with his motor scooter, Gintoki looks inside a vending machine slot] D-don't worry. A-all we have to do is find a t-t-time machine.;;;;;;;;
7085;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Oh crap! Today is Jump release day! I forgot it comes out on Saturday this week! We have to go back!;;;;;;;;
7086;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Shut it! Do you know the pain of having a permanent perm?!;;;;;;;;
7087;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;A samurai doesn't need a reason to do what's right. If you want to protect her, you must draw your sword.;;;;;;;;
7088;(Gintama);Shimura Shinpachi;Damn that sister of mine! She's always talking about our father, but what did that baldy ever do for us?! He just played Othello with us from time to time!;;;;;;;;
7089;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Leave it at that. Even though she was raised by gorillas, she's still a woman.;;;;;;;;
7090;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;*to Shinpachi* Was your sister raised by gorillas?;;;;;;;;
7091;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;*after Shinpachi caught up to him, while running from the police* What a nice boy you are. Have you come to return my wooden sword? That's all right. It was just a souvenir I bought on a school trip.;;;;;;;;
7092;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Blah, blah, blah, blah… quit your blabbering. Look at this. [holds up an empty glass] Thanks to you assholes, my chocolate parfait [hits one of the amanto with his bokuto] fell to the ground!;;;;;;;;
7093;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Ah, I wish I could have a bankai like that.;;;;;;;;
7094;(Gintama);Isao Kondō;Hey, if you take a step over that line, your territorial law won't mean shit!;;;;;;;;
7095;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;You can't just run away, especially from the things you want to forget!;;;;;;;;
7096;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Don't go thinking you're my rival, you circus freak!;;;;;;;;
7097;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;[crashing through the gate on his motor scooter] Thanks for the support! Here come the real heros!;;;;;;;;
7098;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;That's like what an evil organization in some anime would do.;;;;;;;;
7099;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;We're not going to sneak in, we're gonna bust in. To bust in means to go in from the front, guns blazing.;;;;;;;;
7100;(Gintama);Isao Kondō;I've told you before, he's not one to trust, Otae-san. No trustworthy man has eyes that look like a dead fish's eyes.;;;;;;;;
7101;(Gintama);Kagura;*talking about Gintoki* It's the same as always. He doesn't pursue those who leave, and ignores those who come.;;;;;;;;
7102;(Gintama);Shimura Shinpachi;[Shinpachi is tied up, hanging from a tree, and the rope is held by the client] What kind of training is this? What kind of potential does he have?;;;;;;;;
7103;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;*after Katsura asks him about what he is doing* Well, I suppose I'm doing something odd, like jogging or taking a walk or something like that.;;;;;;;;
7104;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;[after the client asks Shinpachi, Kagura and Ayame to get him stronger] Well, whatever. At any rate, raise his hit points another hundred or so.;;;;;;;;
7105;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Hey, what's that natto for, anyway? If you intend to seduce me with it, you're way off base, you know.;;;;;;;;
7106;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;The earth's rowdier than a group of five high school guys living under the same roof.;;;;;;;;
7107;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;What are you, some tantrum throwing brat who forgot to buy his Jump? Having no money is like having a sinus infection. You just have to ignore it and not pick at it, and it'll go away.;;;;;;;;
7108;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Yeah, I know. It's not good to be reading Jump at my age.;;;;;;;;
7109;(Gintama);Okita Sougo;Goodbye, vice captain. Why don't you suck on some mayonnaise in the afterlife? [he shoots, blowing up the whole wall];;;;;;;;
7110;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;What are you talking about? We LET you corner us.;;;;;;;;
7111;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Oi, oi, why are you letting them chase you, idiot?;;;;;;;;
7112;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;You will never be able to love anybody else until you love your self...;;;;;;;;
7113;(Macross Frontier);Alto Saotome;The sky is so low.;;;;;;;;
7114;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;Our souls, together till the end!;;;;;;;;
7115;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;I'll admit, Black Star makes some dumb calls from time to time, but the important thing is I'm here to back him up no matter how big a fool he is. If we're fools, we're fools together, that's the kind of team we are.;;;;;;;;
7116;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;You guys are a team, you have to work together if you want to do anything! One person can't make a decision without the other, you decide together and you fight together!;;;;;;;;
7117;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;I have a friend who has helped me realize something. He's helped me see that a Camellia does have a fragrance!;;;;;;;;
7118;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;When I fall it will be silent and tragic.;;;;;;;;
7119;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;The Camellia Blossom also know as Tsubaki, is a flower without fragrance. It proclaims nothing, blooming in silence. When the blossomed pettles scatter, it's quietly tragic. I am Tsubaki. A silent flower without fragrance.;;;;;;;;
7120;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;Silence means approaching quietly!;;;;;;;;
7121;(Soul Eater);Tsubaki Nakatsukasa;Excuse me... I'm not a microphone! I'm a chain scythe.;;;;;;;;
7122;(Soul Eater);Black Star;As long as I don't admit defeat, then it'll never be a loss!;;;;;;;;
7123;(Soul Eater);Black Star;If it's fear that you speak of, then I'll stand and face it. I'll never give up. The only time I lose is when I die!;;;;;;;;
7124;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I'll never show you my tears. These are the tears of those who died with regrets. If there's a way to take away these regrets, I'll make sure I'll find it.;;;;;;;;
7125;(Soul Eater);Black Star;It's Me with a capital M! I'm the only one big enough to capitalize Me!;;;;;;;;
7126;(Soul Eater);Black Star;London bridge is falling down dude!;;;;;;;;
7127;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Who cares about snow? Snow can't touch me, I could be naked out here and it wouldn't bother me at all.;;;;;;;;
7128;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I'm not going to let myself get beaten by a jar!;;;;;;;;
7129;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I'm Black Star. I'm on a whole different level than you. I'm a big man! I beat death! Who else can say that?!;;;;;;;;
7130;(Soul Eater);Black Star;My soul wave length just got taken away. I'm gonna miss it.;;;;;;;;
7131;(Soul Eater);Black Star;What's the point of worrying about the past? A real star keeps moving forward.;;;;;;;;
7132;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Hey, Tsubaki, come out of there already. You haven't lost to him, have you? You can put on a better show than that, come back out on stage. Encore, encore. Tsubaki encore, give us an encore!;;;;;;;;
7133;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Alright then! Come here! Come over here, Black Star's giving you a big hug!;;;;;;;;
7134;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I'm just a dude who's way ahead of his time you know? Does that mean I was born too early because time can't keep up with me?;;;;;;;;
7135;(Soul Eater);Black Star;You can lean on me, Tsubaki.;;;;;;;;
7136;(Soul Eater);Black Star;The tattoo is a symbol of my family, the Star Clan. They were a clan of assassins. Everybody knew they would do anything for money. After a while killing people wasn't enough, they were hungry for even more power so they began hunting human souls. But now it's just me, I'm the last member of the Star Clan. 13 years ago their souls were taken by Lord Death and the Meisters from the Academy. At the time I was still a baby, so they didn't take my soul. That's when the school took me in. That's it. The end.;;;;;;;;
7137;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Stars. Don't. Clean.;;;;;;;;
7138;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Soul! Soul! Are you okay?! You are going to be alright - Black Star is here for you now!! Open your eyes! One look at my big handsome face and you'll be cured for sure!;;;;;;;;
7139;(Soul Eater);Black Star;You wont be laughing once you taste our power of friendship!;;;;;;;;
7140;(Soul Eater);Black Star;It could be real difficult to hide when you're as big a star as I am.;;;;;;;;
7141;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Finishing Strike! Black Star Big Wave!;;;;;;;;
7142;(Soul Eater);Black Star;You can look high or low but you wont find a bigger guy than me!;;;;;;;;
7143;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Compared to a man as big as me you realize how small you are, don't you? I understand how you feel. Even I can be frightened by my own greatness. So I find it difficult to stand in front of mirrors.;;;;;;;;
7144;(Soul Eater);Black Star;My name is Black Star. I'll surpass the power of the gods.;;;;;;;;
7145;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Dying now, my breath will be erased, okay?;;;;;;;;
7146;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Sometimes I'm such a big star that I can't handle it.;;;;;;;;
7147;(Soul Eater);Black Star;I am the great assassin Black Star! And I've come here to assassinate you all!;;;;;;;;
7148;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Assassins Rule Number Three - Speed: Take out the target before the target notices your presence.;;;;;;;;
7149;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Assassins Rule Number Two - Transpositional Thinking: Analyze the target in order to predict his thoughts and movements.;;;;;;;;
7150;(Soul Eater);Black Star;Assassins Rule Number One - Silence: Dissolve in the darkness and erase your breath. Wait for an opening to attack your target.;;;;;;;;
7151;(Soul Eater);Black Star;YAAAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;
7152;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;You're stubborn and reckless, all you like to do for fun is read, so you're boring, and you have fat ankles.;;;;;;;;
7153;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Anybody want to take the sexy kitty home? She's free.;;;;;;;;
7154;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;If you forget your fear you become reckless.;;;;;;;;
7155;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;As far as I know music isn't picky about when it gets played.;;;;;;;;
7156;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;What is this place? Where am I? Wherever it is, it's completely dark. I can't even see my own body. It hurts... Which way is up? Which way is down? Where am I supposed to go? Someone help me.;;;;;;;;
7157;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;I am your weapon partner Maka! That means I'm always prepared to die for my Meister!;;;;;;;;
7158;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;You know what they say! When in Rome eat lots of pasta!;;;;;;;;
7159;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;I'm hungry! can we just get his damn zombie soul already?;;;;;;;;
7160;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Come out! Nap times over zombie!;;;;;;;;
7161;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;I hope it's a cool morning. That's how cool days always start out. And a cool guy like me deserves the coolest morning possible.;;;;;;;;
7162;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Souls are so yummy.;;;;;;;;
7163;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;In the end the shape and form don't matter at all, it's only the soul that matters right? Nothing else.;;;;;;;;
7164;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;After all cool men don't cheat on their partners, do they?;;;;;;;;
7165;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Damn that witch. How am I supposed to be cool when she is all hot and naked like that huh?;;;;;;;;
7166;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;It's okay, cool guys see naked women all the time, I'm totally used to it.;;;;;;;;
7167;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Your soul is mine!;;;;;;;;
7168;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;Naked lady!;;;;;;;;
7169;(Soul Eater);Soul Evans;What are you smoking? Don't you see how cool I am? You think I'm going to settle for a flat chested girl like her?;;;;;;;;
7170;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;We might be scared but that's what makes us stronger!;;;;;;;;
7171;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;Watch it, or I'll take your soul!;;;;;;;;
7172;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;What could that creep possibly be thinking sending sexy underwear to his own daughter.;;;;;;;;
7173;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;Papa was only 18 years old when I was born. He used to read a lot of books to me back then.;;;;;;;;
7174;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;It doesn't hurt! It's not hot! I'm not scared! I will not be beaten!;;;;;;;;
7175;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;I refuse to let my fear control me anymore.;;;;;;;;
7176;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;We have to find a way to face this scar.;;;;;;;;
7177;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;I was wondering. Do souls taste good? You seem to like 'em.;;;;;;;;
7178;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;Stop looking at my soul you creep!;;;;;;;;
7179;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;The legendary super-skill of the Scythe-Meister! Witch Hunter!;;;;;;;;
7180;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;People need fear to survive. We experience it so we can grow stronger.;;;;;;;;
7181;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;You men. All of you, you're horrible. Cheating on every woman. But you, you I actually decided to trust. I put my faith in you. I can't believe this. I wish that all of you would just die!;;;;;;;;
7182;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;42-42-564 whenever you wanna knock on deaths door.;;;;;;;;
7183;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;A sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body.;;;;;;;;
7184;(Soul Eater);Maka Albarn;MAKA CHOP!;;;;;;;;
7185;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Wrong, holy man. All we want is to get our bodies normal again. See, we don't lie about what's possible. We didn't start a cult.;;;;;;;;
7186;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Sun, it's just a mass of hydrogen... Get too close to it and all you do is burn.;;;;;;;;
7187;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Riza Hawkeye;*referring to Armstrong taking off his shirt* Did he have to strip?..;;;;;;;;
7188;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Scar;Foolish alchemists who have turned their backs on the ways of God...shall all be punished.;;;;;;;;
7189;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Solf J. Kimblee;"I think you've got me all wrong. My motives aren't so sophisticated as ""revenge"" or ""honor"" or any of that... The reason I killed all of those men... was because I could. It's that simple.";;;;;;;;
7190;(Fullmetal Alchemist);King Bradley;You clearly have nerves of steel. But, I'd say you still have much to learn about the world.;;;;;;;;
7191;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Save your breath. The laws of alchemy don't justify murder!;;;;;;;;
7192;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Whoever invented stew is brilliant! It has milk in it and it still tastes good.;;;;;;;;
7193;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Hughes again? Put him through. It's me. I won't listen if you're going to be bragging about your daughter. *...* Hughes? Hughes... Hey! Hughes! Hughes!!;;;;;;;;
7194;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;You're lucky Al. Since your body's huge.;;;;;;;;
7195;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;*referring to Winry* I didn't know she could be so cute.;;;;;;;;
7196;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Scar;For one that turns against God to come in person to receive judgement... Today is a good day!;;;;;;;;
7197;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Scar;I am an instrument of divine judgment!;;;;;;;;
7198;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Scar;No matter what, if you intend to interfere, I will eliminate you too.;;;;;;;;
7199;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Riza Hawkeye;If there is such a thing as the work of the devil, then there's no doubt it's what happened in this incident.;;;;;;;;
7200;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Hey, mutt! I need exercise, so I'll play with you!;;;;;;;;
7201;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;*to Edward* There's something disturbing about having to be in your debt...;;;;;;;;
7202;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Don't give alcohol to minors!;;;;;;;;
7203;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;It was just a rebound! Don't make a big deal over one or two arms!;;;;;;;;
7204;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;If there's no door, then I'll make one!;;;;;;;;
7205;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Come down here and face me, you third-rate fraud. I'll show you there's no comparison between us!;;;;;;;;
7206;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;It's like that myth about the hero... He made wings out of wax so he could fly... but when he got too close to the sun... to God... the wax melted and he crashed to the ground...;;;;;;;;
7207;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Rose Tomas;What pride... are you saying that you are God's equal?;;;;;;;;
7208;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;"AHA-HA-HA! Alchemists are scientists. We don't believe in unprovable concepts like ""God"". *Rose looks angry* We strive to uncover the principles of creation in the matter of the world, to pursue truth... *gazes at Leto statue* it's ironic that we scientists... who don't believe in God... are in a sense the closest things to him.";;;;;;;;
7209;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Ed believes he saved that town, it's one of the first successes he's had. I'll let him keep thinking that for a while. He'll learn the truth soon enough: we always do.;;;;;;;;
7210;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;DON'T CALL ME SMALL! I'LL BREAK DOWN YOUR FEET AND STICK THEM ON YOUR HEAD!!;;;;;;;;
7211;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;Of course! Dogs embody loyalty, they follow their master's commands above all else! Be a jerk to them and they don't complain, and they never once beg for a paycheck! Trust me Fuery, they're the great servants of man! *singing* Loyal canine how we salute thee! *laughs maniacally*;;;;;;;;
7212;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Yeah, I get it. You couldn't see me since I'm so short, you couldn't distinguish me from all the grains of sand. VERY FUNNY!!;;;;;;;;
7213;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Even with your stones, I'm on a whole other level!;;;;;;;;
7214;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;You know, it's funny. Every crook I meet wants to tell me how much I'm just like them. But there's a big difference between you and me and the burdens we bear.;;;;;;;;
7215;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;WHO ARE YOU CALLING SO SMALL YOU WANNA CRUSH LIKE AN ANT?!;;;;;;;;
7216;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Come on now. Is that anyway to talk to your new boss, landlord, and all-around overseer?;;;;;;;;
7217;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;I don't know if we chose the right path, brother. But I do know this: I don't want to be in this suit anymore. I want to feel things again. It's strange. We've been right beside each other all this time. But I can't remember what your skin feels like, or how you smell.;;;;;;;;
7218;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;CHILDBIRTH'S NOT ALCHEMY, YOU DOPE!;;;;;;;;
7219;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;Those people had us dancing right in the palms of their hands, didn't they? I guess it doesn't matter what we do. We'll never be the ones in control.;;;;;;;;
7220;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Roy Mustang;You can call me Roy Mustang, or just Lieutenant Colonel. Hell, you can call me the Flame Alchemist. Whatever you do, remember the pain.;;;;;;;;
7221;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Attention, gun-toting extremists! Can you hear me all right, or did you blow your ears out playing target practice?;;;;;;;;
7222;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;WHO ARE YOU CALLING A RUNT SO TINY HE COULD ONLY BE SEEN WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS, YOU JERK!;;;;;;;;
7223;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Riza Hawkeye;*on the phone* I'm sorry to interrupt you, Major, but let me offer a bit of feminine advice. BABIES AREN'T BORN AFTER JUST FIVE MONTHS!;;;;;;;;
7224;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Nobody calls me a pipsqueak and gets away with it! Not even a little girl!;;;;;;;;
7225;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;*referring to Alphonse* This pain's nothing...compared to what he's given up...;;;;;;;;
7226;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;Dad left... A long time ago, when brother and I were still boys. Mom stared off into the distance a lot. But she carried on as if nothing were wrong.;;;;;;;;
7227;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Winry Rockbell;What do I have to live for now that I know Cain won't come back? You tell me that, Ed!;;;;;;;;
7228;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;WHO ARE YOU CALLING A MOUSY LITTLE PIPSQUEAK?!;;;;;;;;
7229;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Told you, Rose. Get too close to the sun, and you'll burn.;;;;;;;;
7230;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Don't look away, Rose! You need to see what happens when you try to bring a human to life, when you cross into God's territory or whatever the hell it is! Is this what you want?! Look!!;;;;;;;;
7231;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;By the way, I don't get my skills from a pocketwatch.;;;;;;;;
7232;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;You combined animals, the most depraved kind of alchemy there is.;;;;;;;;
7233;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;It's true, I don't have a body, but I'm here. This is my punishment for setting foot on holy ground where mortals are forbidden. We made a mistake, Rose, and we're paying for it.;;;;;;;;
7234;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;*grabs two citizens and swings them around in a circle* Shorty?! Could a shorty do this?! What else you want to call me: a half-pint bean-sprout midget?! I'm still growing you backwater desert idiots!;;;;;;;;
7235;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;*spits out his juice* I don't think so, pops! Do I look like a clown to you?!;;;;;;;;
7236;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;I sunk again. *after sinking in the desert*;;;;;;;;
7237;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;I hate deserts. It's nothing but sand. *collapses* If there was some grass, I could turn it into bread. I'm starving! Huh? Hey! Al, where'd you go? Al? Hey!;;;;;;;;
7238;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Edward Elric;Alchemy: The science of understanding the structure of matter, breaking it down, then reconstructing it as something else. It can even make gold from lead. But alchemy is a science, so it must follow the natural laws: To create, something of equal value must be lost. This is the principle of Equivalent Exchange. But on that night, I learned the value of some things can't be measured on a simple scale. My brother and I knew the laws of science, of Equivalent Exchange, that gain required sacrifice, that something had to be taken from us. But we thought there was nothing more we could lose. We were wrong.;;;;;;;;
7239;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;The Philosopher's Stone: those who possess it, no longer bound by the laws of equivalent exchange in alchemy, can gain without sacrifice...create without equal exchange. We searched for it... and we found it.;;;;;;;;
7240;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Fay D. Flourite;Kuro-woof-woof.;;;;;;;;
7241;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Kurogane;I don't wanna see your face ever again. Keep that helmet on until you die.;;;;;;;;
7242;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Fay D. Flourite;Fighting's fine, but losing looks like it'll hurt... so that'd suck.;;;;;;;;
7243;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Sakura Kinomoto;*Holding Syaoran's hand* If I sleep like this, the first person I want to see when I wake up, is Syaoran.;;;;;;;;
7244;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Kurogane;I work by myself. Only for Princess Tomoyo.;;;;;;;;
7245;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Yuuko Ichihara;Readiness and sincerity, qualities that are indispensible in order to accomplish anything. Qualities you are well provided with.;;;;;;;;
7246;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Yuuko Ichihara;But there are no coincidences in this world. There is only Hitsuzen. You were destined to meet each other.;;;;;;;;
7247;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Yuuko Ichihara;Fine then, in exchange, you can roam around looking like a cosplayer, violate weapon laws, get arrested by the police, and get interviewed on television.;;;;;;;;
7248;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Sakura Kinomoto;"In my room at the palace, right before I go to sleep... I always think to myself, ""What's Syaoran doing right now? Is he thinking about me?"".";;;;;;;;
7249;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Fay D. Flourite;Can't whistle, so I just say the words wheet-whoo.;;;;;;;;
7250;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Fay D. Flourite;To all the young ones in your group, you are no longer someone who passes through their lives and is forgotten. You have become someone very important to them. Your hardships are their hardships too.;;;;;;;;
7251;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Syaoran Li;No matter how painful it might be... I'll do everything in my might! So please, you too, act according to what you believe in!;;;;;;;;
7252;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Fay D. Flourite;*punches Kurogane* That was payback, Kuro-sama!;;;;;;;;
7253;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Sakura Kinomoto;Because I wished for everyone to live, I did everything I could.;;;;;;;;
7254;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Kurogane;*yelling at Fai* You, shut up!! If you want to die that much, I'll kill you myself! But until that day, you're going to live!;;;;;;;;
7255;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Kurogane;For all my life... I've wanted strength. I didn't want those things precious to me to be taken away from me anymore. But, to have strength means to invite disaster to come to you. And strength alone can't really protect you.;;;;;;;;
7256;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Syaoran Li;Because we knew you were waiting, we did our best so that we'd return.;;;;;;;;
7257;(Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle);Syaoran Li;If I can protect, I want to protect.;;;;;;;;

7260;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;That's right. Our weakness is that we're utterly stupid.;;;;;;;;
7261;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;Glad you're okay *wink* I kinda like you.;;;;;;;;

7265;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;Are you saying I can be god?;;;;;;;;
7266;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;I said she's not an Angel. She's a human, just like us. Didn't you notice?;;;;;;;;
7267;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;Hey, why does this situation look like something at the end of a shonen manga?!;;;;;;;;
7268;(Angel Beats!);Yui;Care about me!!!;;;;;;;;
7269;(Angel Beats!);Yui;Um, if we encounter the Angel here, I'm going to pee buckets on the spot!;;;;;;;;
7270;(Angel Beats!);Yuri Nakamura;Just give up already. Or do you want my other knife to slice your throat?;;;;;;;;
7271;(Angel Beats!);Kanade Tachibana;Messing around at night together... This calls for punishment.;;;;;;;;
7272;(Angel Beats!);Yui;For all our sake I will sing and pee my heart out in the name of spirit!;;;;;;;;
7273;(Angel Beats!);Ooyama;You got away with just physical damage, but I'm going to take CRITICAL MENTAL DAMAGE!;;;;;;;;
7274;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;Wow, he did it. He's gonna fl- *boosts up to the ceiling and smashes his head*;;;;;;;;
7275;(Angel Beats!);TK;I'll be back.;;;;;;;;
7276;(Angel Beats!);Hideki Hinata;Don't think that the me tomorrow will be the same as the me today. You'd better be careful.;;;;;;;;
7277;(Angel Beats!);Yuzuru Otonashi;What is the resulting amperage when applying 3.0V to a conductor with 20ohm resistance?;;;;;;;;
7278;(Angel Beats!);TK;Knockin' on Heaven's Door.;;;;;;;;
7279;(Angel Beats!);TK;Scrambled it trouble down.;;;;;;;;
7280;(Angel Beats!);TK;He can't dance in my world right now. Don't let me cry!;;;;;;;;
7281;(Angel Beats!);TK;Hey, yo, check this out! It's a moonwalk, it's a moonwalk! Head spin!;;;;;;;;
7282;(Angel Beats!);TK;Ouch! Are you serious?;;;;;;;;
7283;(Angel Beats!);TK;Just wild heaven.;;;;;;;;
7284;(Angel Beats!);TK;Come on let's dance... aw yeah don't be afraid.;;;;;;;;
7285;(Axis Powers: Hetalia);Russia;I want to see confused and troubled Lithuania to come crying to me.;;;;;;;;
7286;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;Real GAY will not be swayed no matter how cute a girl is. Please remember this: out of a hundred men... five are GAY.;;;;;;;;
7287;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;Don't use a serious tone. Don't breathe on me. Your face is too close. Freaking me out.;;;;;;;;
7288;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;I didn't abduct her. It was voluntary arrest.;;;;;;;;
7289;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;This feels like extortion.;;;;;;;;
7290;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Yuki Nagato;What is a glasses man?;;;;;;;;
7291;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;...but as they say, it ain't over till the fat lady sings. I don't know which fat lady is doing the singing or where she's planning on doing her singing. But if I find out where she is, I'd like to put her out of commission for a year!;;;;;;;;
7292;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;The person that needs to be as far away from the H-bomb switch as possible in all of Japan, is right here.;;;;;;;;
7293;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;If you're scared, you might as well just cling to my arm. Creates more of an atmosphere.;;;;;;;;
7294;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Yuki Nagato;I'll back off for now. Next time I won't hesitate to destroy you. Take this time to make your tombstone...;;;;;;;;
7295;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Every school story has to have a maid character!;;;;;;;;
7296;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;I had a dream where I fell into a surreal world with a girl I knew, and then ended up kissing her! A dream so easy to understand that even Sigmund Freud would laugh out loud.;;;;;;;;
7297;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Kyon, I'm hot!;;;;;;;;
7298;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;Afterall, the fate of the world rests on my pitching. The world sure isn't worth much these days.;;;;;;;;
7299;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Kyon. The contest begins the second someone challenges you. Anything the loser says otherwise is merely an excuse.;;;;;;;;
7300;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Mikuru Asahina;Kyon-kun. If I become ruined for marriage will you take me?;;;;;;;;
7301;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*to Haruhi* I'm begging you. Establish the context before you start talking.;;;;;;;;
7302;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*thinking* Normally, one would call an ambulance or ask for help from one of the nearby residents, but this particular boy decided to carry the unconscious, innocent girl... and where the hell are you taking her, bastard?;;;;;;;;
7303;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Remote islands are all about strange incidents, right?;;;;;;;;
7304;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*to Haruhi* Are you a moron?;;;;;;;;
7305;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*commenting on Haruhi's naming of the SOS brigade* Haruhi's incomprehensible words settled the matter. Oh, joy. Just do whatever you want.;;;;;;;;
7306;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*referring to Haruhi* She must have been born dumb.;;;;;;;;
7307;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;Emblem? Looks like a grumbling, drunken tapeworm to me.;;;;;;;;
7308;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;And without any buildup or fanfare, we now see Nagato Yuki. Even if she were ordinary, she sure doesn't look like a normal person and naturally, she was actually an evil magician. And an alien on top of that.;;;;;;;;
7309;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;If your face gets any closer, someone who isn't supposed to be in this scene is going to come over there and kick your ass!;;;;;;;;
7310;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;A picture of you sleeping with a stupid look on your face totally oblivious to the dangers of this trip serves as a warning to future generations!;;;;;;;;
7311;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*referring to Haruhi* It would appear that she views guys on the same level as potatoes.;;;;;;;;
7312;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;"Anyone accepting defeat will be punished by running ten laps around the school, naked! And you'll have to yell ""Green Martians are chasing me!"" for the whole ten laps!";;;;;;;;
7313;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;Let's calm down. The enemy is shooting at us.;;;;;;;;
7314;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;It's time to launch the dams!;;;;;;;;
7315;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;*thinking* Every day, I hang out with an alien, a time traveler, and a Esper...and I'm still as sane and objective as ever. Hmm...I wonder if that makes me special or something.;;;;;;;;
7316;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;... After all, our goal each year should be to increase the NUMBER of goals we set for ourselves!;;;;;;;;
7317;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Tsuruya;*mockingly* That's amazing, Mikuru! We're counting on you! The Earth is in your-- *breaks into uncontrollable and hysterical laughter*;;;;;;;;
7318;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Tsuruya;I can't take you seriously when you're dressed like that! I'm sorry, Mikuru, but I'm being controlled by the alien right now. Here goes nothing!;;;;;;;;
7319;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;Well, I don't think we can deny the distinct possibility that the world we are in now was freshly created, by Her, last night! In any case, it's an honor to meet you and Miss Suzumiya again. *laughing softly* Be seeing you after class!;;;;;;;;
7320;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;You're the new Adam and Eve. Go on, procreate, increase the population.;;;;;;;;
7321;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;"The top brass at the organization is seriously panicked, right now. Nobody knows what will happen to the ""real world"", now that we've lost our Deity. If Miss Suzimiya is feeling merciful, we might get to keep on living, on this side of the bubble.";;;;;;;;
7322;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;I don't know how I know, I just know that I know, y'know?;;;;;;;;
7323;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Itsuki Koizumi;Sometimes I get the feeling that we're all just a bunch of clowns standing on our tiptoes at the edge of a great abyss.;;;;;;;;
7324;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;If there's really that many people in the world, then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary. There had to be someone who was living an interesting life. There just had to be. Why wasn't I that person?;;;;;;;;
7325;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;You know, Kyon...have you ever realized just how insignificant your existence on this planet really is?;;;;;;;;
7326;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Asakura Ryouko;Oh please, won't you just give up? You're going to die no matter what, so let me kill you.;;;;;;;;
7327;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Asakura Ryouko;You think it's a joke? Huh. You don't want to die? You don't want me to kill you? I'm sorry, but I just don't understand the concept of death regarding organic lifeforms.;;;;;;;;
7328;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Kyon;Stop kidding around! You're gonna hurt someone with that! Even if that's a rubber knife, you're scaring the hell out of me!;;;;;;;;
7329;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Asakura Ryouko;*to Kyon* I'm getting bored and just fed up watching something that doesn't seem to be changing at all. That's why...I'm going to kill you and see how Miss Suzumiya reacts.;;;;;;;;
7330;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Listen! This isn't fun and games! You mess around and I'll kill ya!;;;;;;;;
7331;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Yuki Nagato;I am not referring to the absence of universally accepted personality traits. What I mean is literal, that Haruhi and I are not like other organic lifeforms such as yourself.;;;;;;;;
7332;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;It's exactly what the SOS Brigade needs! We need something like a mysterious transfer student!;;;;;;;;
7333;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Then I'll tell everyone at school that all you geeks ganged up on her and ed her.;;;;;;;;
7334;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;Feelings of love are just a temporary lapse in judgment. Like a mental illness.;;;;;;;;
7335;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Haruhi Suzumiya;I'm Haruhi Suzumiya, from East Junior High. First off, I'm not interested in ordinary people. But, if any of you are aliens, time-travelers, or espers, please come see me. That is all!;;;;;;;;
7336;(The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya);Mikuru Asahina;That's classified information.;;;;;;;;
7337;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;*to Yammy after recieving his punch*  I barely feel a thing. Now I'm sure you think I'm a big fly or something. But if you are going to punch, you better put in some effort you great big worm.;;;;;;;;
7338;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Never admit defeat and ask for a quick death! Die first, then admit defeat! If you are defeated but didn't die, it just means you were lucky! At those times, think only about survival! Survive and think only about killing the one who failed to kill you!;;;;;;;;
7339;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;You idiot! There's always shadows wherever there's light!;;;;;;;;
7340;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Oh, shut up. I was just thinkin'. With four arms, you're just gonna keep on blockin' my blade. That's no fun at all. So, while I was layin' on the ground, I was thinkin' about how to stop you blockin' all my attacks. But, you know...I couldn't think up a single good idea lying down there. So I figure...I'll just have to take out those arms, one by one.;;;;;;;;
7341;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Finished? It'll never be finished. A battle isn't like some stupid argument. As long as someone's still breathing, the fight isn't over.;;;;;;;;
7342;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Playing comes first, you can work later!;;;;;;;;
7343;(D.Gray-man);Miranda Lotto;The reason that I'm no good... Even though I can't do anything well, I will attempt it anyways. Even though I decide not to try anymore, I regret it, and end up trying again. After all, I can't do anything right, it's better if I just don't try at all. I'm an idiot, aren't I...;;;;;;;;
7344;(D.Gray-man);Miranda Lotto;The old clock that nobody could budge. The sound of the chime moved my heart. It seemed like the clock had approved of my clumsy self.;;;;;;;;
7345;(D.Gray-man);Miranda Lotto;"I've never had anyone say ""thank you"" to me. That means I've never been helpful to anyone. I wanted somebody to say ""thank you"" to me and I wanted them to accept me.";;;;;;;;
7346;(D.Gray-man);Miranda Lotto;You know how there are people who aren't good at anything? Well, that's how I was.;;;;;;;;
7347;(D.Gray-man);Komui Lee;It's not a sacrifice. We're helping each other so we can can live.;;;;;;;;
7348;(D.Gray-man);Komui Lee;Wait Lenalee! Komurin is not evil! The coffee is evil!! Hate the crime, not the person. Hate the coffee, not Komurin, Lenalee.;;;;;;;;
7349;(D.Gray-man);Komui Lee;In this world, the only organisms that get cursed are humans.;;;;;;;;
7350;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;Seeing you like this, you don't look like a villain who's turned the whole world against him.;;;;;;;;
7351;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;As expected, you've gotta be evil to have fun.;;;;;;;;
7352;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;We only look immortal...because you guys are weak!!!;;;;;;;;
7353;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;Haha... He was my enemy. Shouldn't I kill him?;;;;;;;;
7354;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;If I'm not careful, I won't be able to go back. I don't want to lose it. Just... the white side of me... and the black side of me... having both of them is what makes it so enjoyable!;;;;;;;;
7355;(D.Gray-man);Road Kamelot;I guess Noah's can cry.;;;;;;;;
7356;(D.Gray-man);Road Kamelot;Allen has presumably exorcised Tyki’s Noah.;;;;;;;;
7357;(D.Gray-man);Road Kamelot;You know, though I like Allen, my family is also special to me... This kind of feeling is the same as yours, Allen. Don't move. I am not quite myself at the moment. Do you want to see holes open up in the bodies of your companions?;;;;;;;;
7358;(D.Gray-man);Road Kamelot;You're so nice, Allen~ You hate me, don't you? Don't shoot. Your hand is also a weapon, Allen. But an Exorcist crying because an Akuma disappeared is a big no-no. If you act like that, no one will like you. Let's play again sometime, Allen.;;;;;;;;
7359;(D.Gray-man);Millenium Earl;Do not underestimate the Innocence... They will do anything to defeat us... for they are demons.;;;;;;;;
7360;(D.Gray-man);Millenium Earl;There's a famous saying in the East. Even with a crappy gun, shoot a lot and you'll hit something. I have a hell of a lot of Akuma.;;;;;;;;
7361;(D.Gray-man);Millenium Earl;I'm creating Akuma for people's sake.;;;;;;;;
7362;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;You can't just keep quiet and watch anymore, right? You are a failure.;;;;;;;;
7363;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;The time spent in the Order passed on. I soon came to a point where I didn't know whether my smiling face was a lie or not.;;;;;;;;
7364;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;No matter where we go, it's just battles, battles and battles. I get it already, humans are stupid.;;;;;;;;
7365;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;*to Allen* We're not their allies. We're only involved... in order to record history. A Bookman has no need for a heart.;;;;;;;;
7366;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;That's it! I've had it with this. YOU'RE SCARY!! You're freakin' scarier than the Akuma!!;;;;;;;;
7367;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;I don't know, yeah? I'm suspicious of everything. I'm always suspicious of everyone around me. Someone I met yesterday could be an Akuma today. Cause that's the type of thing we're up against. You should understand that, Allen. We are at an overwhelming disadvantage. We're different from you, yeah? Not having that convenient eye. Akuma are mixed in with the humans. The other Exorcists and I... we end up looking at all humans as the Earl's minions.;;;;;;;;
7368;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;Innocence... Please take these feelings and change them into strength to protect everbody. If you do that, I will follow you. I will follow you till the day it all ends. Wherever you take me. But...please, at the end... At the very end, you must promise me you'll let me return to my brother's side.;;;;;;;;
7369;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;Please, God, I hate so much. Grant me power. For the first time, I want the Innocence so much.;;;;;;;;
7370;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;That day, when Brother came for me...that was when I thought I can't run from this place anymore. I stopped running away, back then. I stopped running...and I became an Exorcist.;;;;;;;;
7371;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;You shouldn't treat people's lives like toys. It's as if you're still kids, even though we're about the same age..! You're simply fools trying to look strong! For someone who treats this as a kid's game, Allen-kun who knows the importance of life is much, much stronger than you!!;;;;;;;;
7372;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;Move...Move! You are my legs! SO MOVE!!;;;;;;;;
7373;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;...we will. We will definitely win. I swear.;;;;;;;;
7374;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;Miranda... Don't bear the burden alone, ok? You are not the only Exorcist. We are all in this together. We are all walking this road with you.;;;;;;;;
7375;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;We can't just go back from here. If we turn back now, we are trampling down on the lives of those that got us this far.;;;;;;;;
7376;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;Lavi, when I got back to the ship, I was going to apologize. Allen, you've suffered so much. Yet, you're always looking out for me, thank you. I really shouldn't have borrowed this, Anita's precious hair band... Allen, I... I know you'll come back to us, that's what I decided to believe in.;;;;;;;;
7377;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;I said I'd kill him. Now get lost. Or should I start with you guys first?;;;;;;;;
7378;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;You're naive. We're destroyers, not saviors.;;;;;;;;
7379;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;There are sacrifices that must be made, rookie.;;;;;;;;
7380;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;This coat isn't a pillow for the wounded..!! It's the uniform of an Exorcist!!!;;;;;;;;
7381;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;Die? I...I cannot die before I find that person.;;;;;;;;
7382;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;It's...it's... gross. Knowing there's something inside me I don't understand. It's gross.;;;;;;;;
7383;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;When there's something you can't understand no matter how much you think about it, you can't just let yourself brood over it forever!;;;;;;;;
7384;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Tyki Mikk. There is something about us, Exorcists, that you do not understand. You think Exorcists are mere humans and by destroying their anti-Akuma weapon which is the Innocence...they will become powerless since they are mere humans. But the opponents you should really be afraid of are those humans.;;;;;;;;
7385;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;If it could come true, this is all I'd want. It would have been good if we just played poker and nobody died.;;;;;;;;
7386;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Stupid master... If you die, I'll hate you for it.;;;;;;;;
7387;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Because I am a small man, my heart is moved by what's in front of my eyes, not by what the world needs. I just can't abandon what's there in front of me. I want to protect everything I can!;;;;;;;;
7388;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Finally... I have come here, Mana. Finally, I am at the starting line.;;;;;;;;
7389;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;Hey, you, don't you dare call me by my first name or I'll slice you up!;;;;;;;;
7390;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Bring salvation to this poor akuma's soul!;;;;;;;;
7391;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;I will shave your entire body.;;;;;;;;
7392;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Kanda, isn't your long hair in the way? You should cut it. *after that Kanda tells him to GO DIE*;;;;;;;;
7393;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;As If I'd go down that easily, dumbass.;;;;;;;;
7394;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;He's a she!;;;;;;;;
7395;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;"*beating his hammer in the sand* It's just like whack-a-mole and of course ""Strike""!";;;;;;;;
7396;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;General Cross is worse than an akuma.;;;;;;;;
7397;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;*to Allen* Bean sprout!;;;;;;;;
7398;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Wow you guys are slow.;;;;;;;;
7399;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;Allen, you know you're bleeding, right?;;;;;;;;
7400;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;*after Lenalee hits Lavi* Wow, Lenalee's punch of love.;;;;;;;;
7401;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;The only home that a man should ever need is within his heart.;;;;;;;;
7402;(D.Gray-man);Cross Marian;I'd rather get whipped by a pretty girl like you, than fight this pesky war.;;;;;;;;
7403;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;This world is dark and it's so hard to breathe... but in this instant, when I laughed along with you, I felt that breathing just got a little more easier.;;;;;;;;
7404;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;My left I give you to the Akuma. My right I give you to the humans. Both are a part of me. And equally important. So neither side be disappointed. Humans as well as Akuma will be saved!;;;;;;;;
7405;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;Kid, we came to pick you up, y'know ?;;;;;;;;
7406;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;I am sure to choose my own path and walk down it, right? This path that I'm walking down... It's not the path that was chosen for me, is it?;;;;;;;;
7407;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;God? I don't care about that. I've made an oath to myself that I would destroy the devil! To my friends that I would fight alongside them! To my Father that I would keep walking until the end..! I Made An Oath To All Of Them!! This is the only path that I can take to feel alive.;;;;;;;;
7408;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;It's because of you that we're here now. That is more than enough. I'll bear my own injuries. As long as I live, I'll be able to recover. If I live, I can heal. Although scars will remains.;;;;;;;;
7409;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;Even if I can no longer see out of my left eye, I intend to continue being an exorcist... Just like my friends. I have made the vow.;;;;;;;;
7410;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;This is bad, Lenalee! You have to think more sexy thoughts, or else, you'll never find a lover!;;;;;;;;
7411;(D.Gray-man);Cross Marian;What would you do if I told you that you would have to kill someone you love when you become the fourteenth?..;;;;;;;;
7412;(D.Gray-man);Komui Lee;Hate the game, not the player. Hate the coffee, not komurin II.;;;;;;;;
7413;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;I want to be a destroyer who saves.;;;;;;;;
7414;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;*to Lavi* Get of your high horse!;;;;;;;;
7415;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;Kitchen Knife-kun!;;;;;;;;
7416;(D.Gray-man);Komui Lee;I'm a master of science.;;;;;;;;
7417;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;If you're going to fall, do it by yourself!;;;;;;;;
7418;(D.Gray-man);Timothy Hearst;Boobie squeeze!;;;;;;;;
7419;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;*to Allen* If it gets cold we're gonna have to cuddle.;;;;;;;;
7420;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;I ain't your son!;;;;;;;;
7421;(D.Gray-man);Yu Kanda;You fake gentleman!;;;;;;;;
7422;(D.Gray-man);Tyki Mikk;*after Road suggests to make a farewell party for Skin* Don't you mean a funeral.;;;;;;;;
7423;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;It's just as you say. I wanted to tell you, that I'd come back. I knew you'd come for me, Brother... This time, I will kill you. I will kill you and become the Millenium Earl!;;;;;;;;
7424;(D.Gray-man);Lavi;War is sorrowful. The flames of war burn away life and dreams and bonds, leaving behind countless sorrows. So sorrow gives birth to tragedy. And tragedy gives birth to Akuma.;;;;;;;;
7425;(D.Gray-man);Lenalee Lee;If there's nobody left, even if the real world is saved, I'll be destroyed...;;;;;;;;
7426;(D.Gray-man);Cross Marian;Let's overlook everything you did to the members of the Order... I'm not that cruel of a man after all. But then again, you went and messed up my clothes.;;;;;;;;
7427;(D.Gray-man);Cross Marian;Oi! You! You're in the presence of a beautiful being! Filthy things shouldn't get near me!;;;;;;;;
7428;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;No matter how faint our hopes are, even if we don't have anything we can rely on...I will NEVER give up!;;;;;;;;
7429;(D.Gray-man);Cross Marian;A path is something you create as you walk it. The ground you've trodden hardens, and that's what forms your path. You're the only one who can create your own path.;;;;;;;;
7430;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Yukito Tsukishiro;*Laughing* Touya, you can't help but think that Sakura is really, really cute.;;;;;;;;
7431;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Yue;I see you have a determined spirit, Sakura... however... I am not as sentimental as Keroberos.;;;;;;;;
7432;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Touya Kinomoto;I'm really lucky to have a dinosaur for a little sister!;;;;;;;;
7433;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Meiling Li;If he can fly, I can fly! I can do anything he can!;;;;;;;;
7434;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;You really loved Mr. Clow, didn't you? It hurts, doesn't it? It hurts to lose someone you love.;;;;;;;;
7435;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Clow Reed;Water... is a thing that flows.;;;;;;;;
7436;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;*to Syaoran* No matter what you are thinking, if you don't say it, you won't be able to express it.;;;;;;;;
7437;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;*to Kero* Our relationship chart has gotten rather complicated.;;;;;;;;
7438;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Eriol Hiiragizawa;I didn't know everything. There were a couple things that happened that weren't expected by myself or Clow Reed.;;;;;;;;
7439;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Eriol Hiiragizawa;In this life, I'm known as Eriol Hiiragizawa. In my past life, I was known as...Clow Reed.;;;;;;;;
7440;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Eriol Hiiragizawa;*to Sakura* A smile suits best on your face.;;;;;;;;
7441;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Syaoran Li;*to Sakura* I... I love you.;;;;;;;;
7442;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Syaoran Li;I'm going to get all the Clow cards.;;;;;;;;
7443;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Syaoran Li;Even if I lose this feeling, I'm sure that I'll just fall in love with you all over again.;;;;;;;;
7444;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;I am not a monster!;;;;;;;;
7445;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;*to Yue*  I don't want to be your master. I want to be your friend.;;;;;;;;
7446;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;The person he loves, I love that person too, and I'm sure that person loves him too. So it's okay that he doesn't love me.;;;;;;;;
7447;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;Whatever your thoughts may be, if you don't say them, none of them will be acknowledged by others.;;;;;;;;
7448;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Touya Kinomoto;Yuki, have some antidote before you leave. *to Yukito, as he eats Sakura's cooking*;;;;;;;;
7449;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;*to Kero* Stop eating snacks so mindlessly and think of what we can do!;;;;;;;;
7450;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;"*to Li* In the elevator, when you called me ""Sakura"", it made me very happy.";;;;;;;;
7451;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Yukito Tsukishiro;I know! You must be hungry! No wait, that's me.;;;;;;;;
7452;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Kero;Get my cool pose as well!;;;;;;;;
7453;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Spinel Sun;I know our magic is hidden in these forms and he can't sense a thing. But a FAIRY?! How would YOU like to be called a fairy?!;;;;;;;;
7454;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;Men are complicated!;;;;;;;;
7455;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;The greatest happiness for me is to let the person I most like have the most happiness.;;;;;;;;
7456;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Eriol Hiiragizawa;You always look at me with such a scary face.;;;;;;;;
7457;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Tomoyo Daidouji;I have never dreamed that I would be chased by a piano...;;;;;;;;
7458;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;Yue-san is handsome, but Yukito-san is... schweeeet!;;;;;;;;
7459;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Kero;If that brat had become the Master, I'd have lost all my confidence to live!;;;;;;;;
7460;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;Living in a world without the feeling for the person you love most is too harsh!;;;;;;;;
7461;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Sakura Kinomoto;Niichan, you really do work part-time everywhere...;;;;;;;;
7462;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Kero;I'm always where food is!;;;;;;;;
7463;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Touya Kinomoto;Sakura's head is as hard as a rock.;;;;;;;;
7464;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Meiling Li;Do Japanese panthers have wings?!;;;;;;;;
7465;(Cardcaptor Sakura);Kero;Girls are scary when they're angry!;;;;;;;;
7466;(Pandora Hearts);Will Of The Abyss;I always thought that red would suit Cheshire.;;;;;;;;
7467;(Pandora Hearts);Will Of The Abyss;Hey, hurry and come pick me up. I've prepared many different kinds of dolls for you. Let's play together. Let's chat until we feel sleepy. And also... and also... yeah... my beloved ones.;;;;;;;;
7468;(Pandora Hearts);Will Of The Abyss;Hurry. Hurry... come pick me up.;;;;;;;;
7469;(Pandora Hearts);Will Of The Abyss;You will definitely regret... choosing the Black Rabbit over me.;;;;;;;;
7470;(Pandora Hearts);Vincent Nightray;The sky, the people, and me... it's all so red.;;;;;;;;
7471;(Pandora Hearts);Vincent Nightray;No one needs to know what happened 100 years ago.;;;;;;;;
7472;(Pandora Hearts);Vincent Nightray;I... I could never hate you!;;;;;;;;
7473;(Pandora Hearts);Vincent Nightray;You don't remember?.. That's good.;;;;;;;;
7474;(Pandora Hearts);Jack Vessalius;*to Glenn* I don't want to kill you!!;;;;;;;;
7475;(Pandora Hearts);Jack Vessalius;Humans...are weak aren't they?;;;;;;;;
7476;(Pandora Hearts);Jack Vessalius;Be careful. You're being watched by the Will of Abyss.;;;;;;;;
7477;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;She is me, and I am her. Our existence is both the same and different. Alice. That was the name we were given.;;;;;;;;
7478;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;In the book Sharon showed me, there was a man who became more energetic after his cheeks were bitten!;;;;;;;;
7479;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;What is jealousy? Can you eat it? Is it sweet?;;;;;;;;
7480;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;I'm in a contract with you. You are my manservant, and as a manservant, what were you thinking, leaving me behind!?;;;;;;;;
7481;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;I'm scared that I'm not human. I'm scared that I'm different from other chains... I fear the things I don't know. I fear the things I already knew... and at every moment... I always... more than anyone... fear myself the most!;;;;;;;;
7482;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;Shut up, Seaweed Head.;;;;;;;;
7483;(Pandora Hearts);Alice;Nobody touches my PROPERTY! And Oz is my manservant - therefore, he is my property!;;;;;;;;
7484;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;*to Gilbert* Don't think that I will abandon you!;;;;;;;;
7485;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;*to Break* Perhaps Break is a lot weaker than I always thought he was. However, I'm sure that he's a whole lot stronger than he thinks he is.;;;;;;;;
7486;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;I feel so...warm. We know... This calm won't last for long, but...we can't help hoping... That this dreamlike moment... will last.. Forever..;;;;;;;;
7487;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;There's no reason... I'm just merely, obeying what I believe within me!;;;;;;;;
7488;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;So... Alice just has to remain Alice!;;;;;;;;
7489;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;I was rejected, never given any expectations... Then at least, I won't be a burden to others. It's alright if the only one who hurts is me!;;;;;;;;
7490;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;It's fine, dummy! Since you're the one wearing it! *to Gilbert, while giving him clothes for the coming of age ceremony*;;;;;;;;
7491;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;"I want to know what it is, this ""sin"" they say I've committed.";;;;;;;;
7492;(Pandora Hearts);Oz Vessalius;Alice is my sun.;;;;;;;;
7493;(Pandora Hearts);Cheshire Cat;He makes you unhappy?...well then, Cheshire will destroy him!;;;;;;;;
7494;(Pandora Hearts);Cheshire Cat;Liar, liar, LIAR!!!;;;;;;;;
7495;(Pandora Hearts);Cheshire Cat;You might as well let Cheshire eat you!;;;;;;;;
7496;(Pandora Hearts);Cheshire Cat;Everything that made you sad, everything that hurt you, Cheshire will destroy them!;;;;;;;;
7497;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;In other words, it's fine if you die.;;;;;;;;
7498;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;*to Alice* Shut up, you stupid rabbit.;;;;;;;;
7499;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;*to Oz* No matter what happens, I will be beside you.;;;;;;;;
7500;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;Protecting the master... is supposed to be my job!;;;;;;;;
7501;(Pandora Hearts);Gilbert Nightray;Young Master!;;;;;;;;
7502;(Vampire Knight);Hanabusa Aidou;*after Kain asks him if he getting slapped by Kaname was worth thinking about Yuuki's blood* Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!!;;;;;;;;
7503;(Vampire Knight);Hanabusa Aidou;BANG!;;;;;;;;
7504;(Vampire Knight);Hanabusa Aidou;The nice smell is your blood, Yuki.;;;;;;;;
7505;(Vampire Knight);Hanabusa Aidou;Hey baby, what's your blood type?;;;;;;;;
7506;(Vampire Knight);Kaien Cross;I wish to erase the past but I have killed too many vampires to let that happen.;;;;;;;;
7507;(Vampire Knight);Kaien Cross;His and my passionate oath!;;;;;;;;
7508;(Vampire Knight);Kaien Cross;I want to put an end to the war between humans and vampires – a war that has been continuing in the darkness of history since ancient times! I want the young vampires, with their natural intelligence and unfettered hearts, to become a bridge between the two species!! I'm educating them for that purpose! That is why I created the Night Class!;;;;;;;;
7509;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;What is beautiful is not the world, but your beautiful eyes that embraces it.;;;;;;;;
7510;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;*to Yuki* You have stopped opening your heart to me. That's the only thing about you that has to change.;;;;;;;;
7511;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Are you sure? Even if the hidden truth is drenched in blood... Do you still want to know?;;;;;;;;
7512;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;I've been wondering ever since before, why do you always look so sad whenever you're with me?;;;;;;;;
7513;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;It's all right, for now. Yuki will eventually come to me.;;;;;;;;
7514;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Humans should never be turned into vampires. But in the old days, hidden from history, when the war between vampires and vampire hunters was at its peak, vampires turned many humans into vampires to use in battle. And now the aristocrats have the duty to manage those survivors. Sometimes we have to kill them off...;;;;;;;;
7515;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;It's all right. You be just the way you are, Yuki. You're different from the Night Class students who wait on me... You're a warm-hearted girl, Yuki. That's more than enough.;;;;;;;;
7516;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;The blood has stopped flowing, but the puncture wounds...he really pierced you deeply. Yuki...does it hurt? Are you afraid of vampires now?;;;;;;;;
7517;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;You devoured her mercilessly. She can't even stand up. Was her blood so delicious?;;;;;;;;
7518;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;A human bitten by a pureblood vampire transforms into a vampire. When that happens, there can be only one of two results, dying from the loss of blood, or unfavorably surviving and suffering the pain of slowly transforming into a vampire. Other vampires don't possess this dark power that purebloods have. I respect his strength of will, he was only a human, yet he resisted the powerful vampire instinct for four years.;;;;;;;;
7519;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Headmaster Cross, how much longer are you going to keep Zero in the Day Class? That time is approaching for him.;;;;;;;;
7520;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;After we turn around, the next time we see each other, I will kill you.;;;;;;;;
7521;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;"Listen up, brats! Get the hell back to your dorms! Why do I have to deal with you running around screaming ""Kyaa! Kyaa!"" every damn day?! Why?!";;;;;;;;
7522;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;But you thought it would be okay to become a vampire, right? I will never let you turn into something like that. Even if it means I have to make Kaname Kuran my enemy...and even if it means you will hate me.;;;;;;;;
7523;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;"Former humans eventually fall into the Level E category, Yuki. They gradually lose their sanity, reaching their ""end"" - their destruction.";;;;;;;;
7524;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;I borrowed it from the Headmaster. It's a gun to use against vampires. If I lose the human part of me, and go mad as a vampire...shoot me with that gun. Not yet, but that day will eventually come. Kill me by your own hand then.;;;;;;;;
7525;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;I couldn't stop myself from devouring you. I may kill the next human I target as my prey. Shoot me. You're afraid of me, aren't you? Hold the gun with both hands, and aim straight. Aim for my heart. It's not a crime to kill a vampire.;;;;;;;;
7526;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;You heard it too? The sound of your blood being sucked in by me. After such a hair-raising experience you can't act as if nothing has changed. So don't interfere anymore.;;;;;;;;
7527;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;Come on vampires. I've been pissed off lately.;;;;;;;;
7528;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;The Headmaster talks about the Night Class like they're good vampires who support his pacifism, but I don't trust them. I won't let my guard down. I'm cooperating so I can find the most effective way to kill those beasts in human form.;;;;;;;;
7529;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;I will keep running away so Zero has a reason to live.;;;;;;;;
7530;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;Both of us understand, but neither of us will say it. It's a sin to keep a vampire alive by offering my own blood as bait. We are doing something that is forbidden. No one must find out about this.;;;;;;;;
7531;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;Being like this makes me feel like we've returned to the old days somewhat. Yeah. Zero is Zero. Even if you are a vampire now.;;;;;;;;
7532;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;I didn't understand anything. Zero suffered and suffered for four years. What were you thinking, all by yourself? He loathes vampires so much, he wants to kill them all. All this time, Zero wanted to kill himself too.;;;;;;;;
7533;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Yuki, I can't accept it after all, that my most precious girl was bitten by another.;;;;;;;;
7534;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;When I think of him, I feel so much love and such sadness...is it a bad thing that the same feeling makes me want to latch onto his throat and devour his blood and even his life to taste his feelings in it?;;;;;;;;
7535;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;I refuse to breathe the same air as those creatures. I refuse to wear the stupid uniform full of buttons that those creatures wear. If I am imprisoned in a classroom full of those creatures, I will certainly lose it, I will massacre every single one of them.;;;;;;;;
7536;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;You are the only one who brings color into the dull gray ashes that my heart is.;;;;;;;;
7537;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;If my only option I have is to lose you, then I would prefer death instead. Be it yours, by my hand, or could you please kill me then yuki..?;;;;;;;;
7538;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;Her warm hands against my face like that... They were like a plank I would hold on to, so I wouldn't drown.;;;;;;;;
7539;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;It is the vampire hunter's duty to kill vampires.;;;;;;;;
7540;(Vampire Knight);Hanabusa Aidou;Yuki, who made those wounds on your neck? In our classroom the night before last, we suddenly smelt blood, we were surprised. I was the only one who noticed right away that it was your blood.;;;;;;;;
7541;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;That's right...you should run away. Yuki...you make me cruel.;;;;;;;;
7542;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;I didn't think that the day would come where you would talk about other guys. How unfair.;;;;;;;;
7543;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Yuki, don't cry. For this day to come, I have waited impatiently for a very long time.;;;;;;;;
7544;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;You've finally fallen to the blood lust of beasts, Zero.;;;;;;;;
7545;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;You could never betray her, because you are under her obligation. You are being let to live because of that, Zero. By me.;;;;;;;;
7546;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;I'm a bit annoyed that you bit me without any restraint.;;;;;;;;
7547;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Do not ever forget...who gave you this blood.;;;;;;;;
7548;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;A glimpse of what I saw earlier was something so distant from me. And yet right now, this man is lying here in my arms. It's such a strange feeling.;;;;;;;;
7549;(Vampire Knight);Kaien Cross;"I still think about protecting you two...even if it's considered as an act of taboo by ""humans"".";;;;;;;;
7550;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;Go Yuki... Go and be by the side of the man who can spend an eternity with you.;;;;;;;;
7551;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;I long for him...but I understand. There's a line that vampires and humans can't cross.;;;;;;;;
7552;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;Because Yuui was there, I might have been able to live on...;;;;;;;;
7553;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Yuki is my dear girl. The only one in the entire world.;;;;;;;;
7554;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;You're a disgrace to all vampires.;;;;;;;;
7555;(Vampire Knight);Kaien Cross;If you need to, Zero, you can drink my blood... *blush blush*;;;;;;;;
7556;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;I want these gentle hands... and this kind smile...Even though I should not want such a thing.;;;;;;;;
7557;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Yuki, the safest place is beside me.;;;;;;;;
7558;(Vampire Knight);Yuki Kuran;I love you Kaname-sama. You are the beginning of my world, and everything in that world... So even if I couldn't remember my past...I wasn't scared.;;;;;;;;
7559;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Do you want to be a vampire Yuuki, become a blood sucking monster like me....and live for eternity by my side...?;;;;;;;;
7560;(Vampire Knight);Kaname Kuran;Do you want to be my friend..?;;;;;;;;
7561;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Nia Teppelin;I can't know about somebody who isn't here. But, you shouldn't depend on people who aren't here.;;;;;;;;
7562;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Nia Teppelin;Do you want to die? If you're scared, it's okay to run.;;;;;;;;
7563;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;*to Yoko* If your fat ass slows us down, I'll leave you behind, Undergrounder.;;;;;;;;
7564;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;I have no reason to listen to anything a human says!;;;;;;;;
7565;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;*to Kamina* However, surprise attacks need more than surprise. It won't work again.;;;;;;;;
7566;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;*to Kamina* Boasting like that is just asking for death.;;;;;;;;
7567;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;I'll tell you two things: First, any human on the surface will be completely annihilated by our Human Eradication Army. Second, that is my dinner - give it back!;;;;;;;;
7568;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;This-Is-The-Real-Spirit-Of-Men' Cannonball Attack!;;;;;;;;
7569;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;How-Dare-You-Do-That-To-My-Precious-Underling' Punch!!!!;;;;;;;;
7570;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;Well, Well, Well, Well... Listen up, big guys! I'll only say this once... Undefeatable, untouchable, with no regrets! Never looking back, never wavering! You can't win against this man's will! Gurren Brigade's Kamina-sama will be your opponent! Believe it!;;;;;;;;
7571;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;If you become a wall that stands in my way... I'll tear open a hole and break through you every time! That's... MY DRILL!;;;;;;;;
7572;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;We'll break through the heavens and dimensions!;;;;;;;;
7573;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;Our burning blood will cut through fate!;;;;;;;;
7574;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Viral;Now then... I've come to reclaim my helm! That's what I wanted to say, but before that... put on some damn clothes!!!;;;;;;;;
7575;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;*to Nia* I don't fully understand, but it doesn't matter why you were born, or if you're a princess. The Nia right here is you. So it's okay if you just be yourself.;;;;;;;;
7576;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;Who-The-Hell-Do-You-Think-I-Am kick!;;;;;;;;
7577;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;My-Wife-Is-The-Best-In-The-Universe throw!;;;;;;;;
7578;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Yoko Littner;I keep telling you I'm a girl!;;;;;;;;
7579;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;If there's no road, we'll forge it with our own hands!;;;;;;;;
7580;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;If there's a wall in our way, we'll destroy it!;;;;;;;;
7581;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Simon;Bro is dead. He's no longer here. However, on my back, within my heart, he continues to live on!;;;;;;;;
7582;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;When I feel weak, or when I lack self-confidence, I remember Simon's back as he dug tirelessly. I wanted to become a man who's back would never break. That's what I thought.;;;;;;;;
7583;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;When we were trapped in that hole...there was nothing I could do. But Simon just kept on digging. Believing in my show of courage. In the end, he was the one who saved me.;;;;;;;;
7584;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;I didn't have any confidence. I thought I was living the wrong way. Impatiently. Why couldn't I go where my father could? Truthfully, I wasn't strong enough.;;;;;;;;
7585;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Yoko Littner;"Kamina told me before. ""He's the one that always saves me."", ""He's the one that doesn't give up, even at the end."".";;;;;;;;
7586;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;Listen up, Simon. Don't forget. Believe in yourself. Not in you who believes in me. Not in me who believes in you. Believe in yourself!;;;;;;;;
7587;(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann);Kamina;I can't even rest in peace, can I..?;;;;;;;;
7588;(Rozen Maiden);Shinku;In the eyes of the weak, everyone is strong. But I am truly strong.;;;;;;;;
7589;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;Meatball head, don't go in there alone! You'd probably get lost in your own closet!;;;;;;;;
7590;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Psst, hey Rei, major question. You didn't forget to kiss Chad goodbye, did you?;;;;;;;;
7591;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Come on you pastey-faced two-timing nega-twit!;;;;;;;;
7592;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;You want trouble pal... you're lookin' at it!;;;;;;;;
7593;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Hello? Planet earth to player b.;;;;;;;;
7594;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;I'm alright, but the big ugly thing isn't.;;;;;;;;
7595;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;*referring to Tsukino* Are you stupid, or just incredibly lazy?;;;;;;;;
7596;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;You know, Darien. Even in a dream, you're just toogood to be true.;;;;;;;;
7597;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;Stupid weatherman, he NEVER gets it right!;;;;;;;;
7598;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;Who needs sunshine anyways...;;;;;;;;
7599;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;I am Darian, Prince of Earth.;;;;;;;;
7600;(Sailor Moon);Ami Mizuno;The future is something you build by yourself.;;;;;;;;
7601;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Who wants that? I'd rather choose to fall in love and be hurt. Sometimes I can't even sleep because I love someone too much. And there's always sadness in our lives. It's that sad feeling that keeps us going.;;;;;;;;
7602;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;It's sad that a selfish woman like you will never know how wonderful being in love is! Your beautiful world of ice will just be a dark land of death! How could a world without life be beautiful?;;;;;;;;
7603;(Sailor Moon);Rei Hino;We're gonna chew you up, and spit you out!;;;;;;;;
7604;(Sailor Moon);Minako Aino;Whoops! Froze the whipping cream!;;;;;;;;
7605;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;Jupiter Thunder Crash!;;;;;;;;
7606;(Sailor Moon);Minako Aino;Venus Crescent Beam!;;;;;;;;
7607;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;You use you power only for evil, Jedite. Big mistake.;;;;;;;;
7608;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Give it back! Give it back to Raye right now! You'll pay for your rotten ways!;;;;;;;;
7609;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;Bullying little kids, how far you go, pal? Are you just a schoolyard bully?;;;;;;;;
7610;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;I won't let you take her... do you hear me? Nobody takes her without facing me first... YOU'RE DUSTED BUSTER!;;;;;;;;
7611;(Sailor Moon);Rei Hino;I've had it with this itchy costume! We were supposed to be dwarves, remember? Not animals! I feel like some little five-year old back in kindergarten!;;;;;;;;
7612;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;That's as good an excuse as any. Now it's my turn. You better take some notes, 'cause you're gonna get beaten and beaten badly.;;;;;;;;
7613;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;Very impressive, you didn't land a single punch.;;;;;;;;
7614;(Sailor Moon);Mamoru Chiba;You've got guts, Jupiter. But it takes more than guts to beat the Negaverse. Give up now, you'll never win.;;;;;;;;
7615;(Sailor Moon);Rei Hino;Mars Fire Ignite!;;;;;;;;
7616;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;You've got to stop reading so many romance novels!;;;;;;;;
7617;(Sailor Moon);Minako Aino;Look who's talking! You think the paperboy likes you just because he rides by your front door every morning!;;;;;;;;
7618;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;I was just warming up, hotshot.;;;;;;;;
7619;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Better enjoy that laugh, Beryl. It's the last one you'll ever have.;;;;;;;;
7620;(Sailor Moon);Ami Mizuno;Mercury Bubble Blast!;;;;;;;;
7621;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;*to Sammy* You're cruisin' for a bruisin'!;;;;;;;;
7622;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;I am Sailor Moon! I stand for love. And I also stand for justice. And in the name of the Moon, I will punish you!;;;;;;;;
7623;(Sailor Moon);Minako Aino;Venus lovechain encircle!;;;;;;;;
7624;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Moon Prism Power! ...And make it fast!;;;;;;;;
7625;(Sailor Moon);Makoto Kino;But I'm the one with the most talent here!;;;;;;;;
7626;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;A talking cat! Oh man, I have been studying too hard!;;;;;;;;
7627;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;Ow! That hurt! I don't want to do this anymore!;;;;;;;;
7628;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;*while being chased by a jet* How will I ever explain to my friends why I have tire tracks down my back?;;;;;;;;
7629;(Sailor Moon);Usagi Tsukino;I am Sailor Moon, the champion of justice! In the name of the Moon, I will punish you! I will right wrongs and triumph over evil and that means you!;;;;;;;;
7630;(Ouran High School Host Club);Hikaru Hitachiin;Good God, is she in the running for 'brattiest princess ever'? Must've been spoiled rotten when she was growing up;;;;;;;;
7631;(Bleach);Rukia Kuchiki;People are able to hold onto hope, since death is that which cannot be seen.;;;;;;;;
7632;(D.Gray-man);Allen Walker;It's not luck, I'm cheating.;;;;;;;;
7633;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;You're such a child. You talk of nothing but pipe dreams... there are times when people must make painful choices.;;;;;;;;
7634;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;"That's why for you, you have the right to be cruel to me. No matter how much you make me worry or how much danger you put me in, just as much as you like. But these are not enough ""compensation"". Even if I have to sacrifice my left over life for you, I would not utter a word of complaint.";;;;;;;;
7635;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;You said it yourself once...The reason why they look like humans...is so that they can hunt us down more efficiently.;;;;;;;;
7636;(Vampire Knight);Zero Kiriyuu;If you go one step ahead of me, I'll make you cry...;;;;;;;;
7637;(Detective Conan);Shinichi Kudou;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.;;;;;;;;
7638;(Fullmetal Alchemist);Alphonse Elric;Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of equivalent exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one and only truth.;;;;;;;;
7639;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;If he made a ripple in the long, long lazy life of a demon, then Alois Trancy's soul also was worth cracking open, per...haps.;;;;;;;;
7640;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;Passion to insincerity, lies to reality, a stray dog into an Earl. That is...'s but...ler.;;;;;;;;
7641;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;Ciel Phantomhive, I will pierce your soft skin with my needle... and slowly suck out your sensual soul.;;;;;;;;
7642;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;*to Sebastian* Say, have your demonic senses weakened after devoting too much to that human's soul?;;;;;;;;
7643;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;Passion to calm, hesitation to resolve, love to gravestones. That is the Trancy butler.;;;;;;;;
7644;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;I simply have a hell of a desire to devour you, Master.;;;;;;;;
7645;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;For a mere butler, to go that far... Don't worry, Young Master. The menial soul that can give love to one is only a butler.;;;;;;;;
7646;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;*teasing Sebastian* A demon and a butler... I am one too.;;;;;;;;
7647;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;Master.. I will always stay by your side. Day and night, sugar and salt, living and dead, impure and pure.;;;;;;;;
7648;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;*to Sebastian* To touch something that is meant to transport food with one's shoes is a disgrace for a butler!;;;;;;;;
7649;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;*to Alois* I am your loyal servant. Even if you do not try to attract my attention, I want to greedily devour you to the very end.;;;;;;;;
7650;(Kuroshitsuji);Claude Faustus;Yes, Your Highness.;;;;;;;;
7651;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;Everyone, everything is happy!;;;;;;;;
7652;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;*to Ciel* Oh, so we were not going to the restroom together?;;;;;;;;
7653;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;*to Luka* They should all die! All of them! Everything, annihilated!;;;;;;;;
7654;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;My heart was entwined in a spider web. You'll always be my Highness. I wanted your love.;;;;;;;;
7655;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;How does my blood smell? Do you want to devour me now?;;;;;;;;
7656;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;*to Claude* Then show me those eyes. Not the eyes of those villagers who looked as if they'd seen a pile of vomit. Not the old man's greedy, inflamed eyes. That day, those eyes. Those eyes that longed only for me, Claude.;;;;;;;;
7657;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;*to Claude* You are...you yourself are...My Highness!;;;;;;;;
7658;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;Hannah, don't you think a sunny-side-up egg is pitiable? Its shell is broken and it's forced to publicly show an indecorous appearance. Then it becomes an eyeball, internal organs, or a plume. And I rob it of any and all possibilities.;;;;;;;;
7659;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;How pitiable.;;;;;;;;
7660;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;In this world, Earl, there're people who can't survive because of the cruelty of reality. I sell those people dreams.;;;;;;;;
7661;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;The spider's web has already been woven. The more you struggle, the harder it becomes to escape from those bonds. Whatever the prey, once they get involved with me, catching them is only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;
7662;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;I've got to exterminate the bad rats infesting my city, don't I? So I keep a cat. Meow!;;;;;;;;
7663;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;The earl said there's no point in going after the small fries, but someone who tries something once will try it again, right?;;;;;;;;
7664;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;Meh, Ran-Mao is my little sister. Yeah, my sister. Even though we aren't related by blood.;;;;;;;;
7665;(Kuroshitsuji);Lau;*to Ciel* That means you will steadily sink into mud. Even if you step toward a place from which you can't return, you choose not to reveal your screaming for help to other people, eh?;;;;;;;;
7666;(Kuroshitsuji);Madame Red;*referring to Vincent Phantomhive* I came to love my red hair that was just like my father's. I came to love red. I came to love you.;;;;;;;;
7667;(Kuroshitsuji);Madame Red;I used to hate my red hair that was just like my father's. I used to hate red.;;;;;;;;
7668;(Kuroshitsuji);Madame Red;*to Ciel* You want to take revenge for my murdered sister? Sister would definitely have not... we would not have wanted you to be like this.;;;;;;;;
7669;(Kuroshitsuji);Madame Red;*when Ciel questions why he's dressed up as a female for Aleister's party* Because I've always wanted a daughter! A cute daughter who would look lovely in those long flowing dresses!;;;;;;;;
7670;(Kuroshitsuji);Madame Red;*referring to getting into Aleister Chamber's party* Aren't you underestimating me? Aren't I rather popular? A few words here and there and it'll be arranged.;;;;;;;;
7671;(Kuroshitsuji);Maylene;I'll keep to what the young master has told me. To face the master with a clean mansion every day. That is a maid's job. I wipe away the mansion's dirt.;;;;;;;;
7672;(Kuroshitsuji);Maylene;These are my precious glasses that the young master bought for me! These maid outfits as well. Before I'd come here, I'd never worn anything like a skirt. I'm so happy I'm a maid now.;;;;;;;;
7673;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;The young master doesn't give me injections every day. The young master doesn't kill my friends. The young master doesn't lock me up. I love it here. That's why I decided I'd protect it.;;;;;;;;
7674;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;*to Agni, who tells him to be nice to the trees* Treat them kindly,' huh? Before I came here, I don't think I would have understood. But now, I feel like I can do it!;;;;;;;;
7675;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;It used to be that I couldn't go outside like this. So now it's fun to do it every day. I can touch trees and bugs and people.;;;;;;;;
7676;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;*when Agni asks him to mash potatoes* It requires strength? Since that's the case, I might be able to do it! I wanna do it! Please allow me to do it!;;;;;;;;
7677;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;But my strength is too large, so Mr. Sebastian forbids me to touch anything in the kitchen.;;;;;;;;
7678;(Kuroshitsuji);Finnian;*after Sebastian tells him to design the garden* Then... then ... I'll make a cool garden that looks like a transforming robot! Can I?!;;;;;;;;
7679;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Do not-arrogant people exist?;;;;;;;;
7680;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I ... humiliated as a pet ... my house was burnt, my family was killed. I was such a... powerless kid. Therefore, I returned to this place in order to make those people who put me through such fate taste the same humiliation. The successors of the generations killed three years prior would come to me as long as I am the head of the Phantomhive family that stands in their way. I'm waiting ...for them to come and try to kill me here.;;;;;;;;
7681;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;So what? You're another person, so of course you look different. What do you need to be ashamed for? Besides, I'm free to be with whoever I want. No one has the right to say anything about it.;;;;;;;;
7682;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Listen when people are talking to you!!!;;;;;;;;
7683;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;He is nothing more than one of my pawns. However, he is not a normal pawn. He is a pawn that can get across the whole board in one move.;;;;;;;;
7684;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;What are you lazily standing around for? You obtained me my revenge. This is an order! Come and eat my soul already! Until the very moment when you eat all my soul you are my butler - Sebastian Michaelis!;;;;;;;;
7685;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;*to Sebastian* Let's go, you cat-obsessed moron.;;;;;;;;
7686;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I'm sorry. Seeing Sebastian's corpse so many times... is just too much for me...;;;;;;;;
7687;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I'm a human being, Sebastian!;;;;;;;;
7688;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I'm arrogant, but not so much that I'd irresponsibly save someone just to brag about it.;;;;;;;;
7689;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;"*to Sebastian* I don't need your ""fawning"". It's disgusting.";;;;;;;;
7690;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;*to Prince Sohma* Who's my best friend? Don't say such ridiculous things.;;;;;;;;
7691;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;It's in bad taste to play games that make me feel like throwing up, Demon!;;;;;;;;
7692;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Enough already! I'm going to feel queer if I continue to live like this!;;;;;;;;
7693;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;Father, Mother, God, please... Why? Why is there no one? No one comes to our rescue.;;;;;;;;
7694;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;*to Sebastian* You shall never betray me. You shall never leave my side. No matter what!;;;;;;;;
7695;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;I'm afraid today's game was quite uninteresting.;;;;;;;;
7696;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;To smile happily, I've... forgotten.;;;;;;;;
7697;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;*to Sebastian* You idiot!! Do you think I'd dance with a big, male partner like you?!;;;;;;;;
7698;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;It's not like I became her fiancée. I was forced to do it.;;;;;;;;
7699;(Kuroshitsuji);Ciel Phantomhive;"Yes, ""kids"" have a great greed for games.";;;;;;;;
7700;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;*to Sebastian* Ah, I can finally appear before you in my real form! Because isn't it embarrassing to appear before a handsome guy without makeup?;;;;;;;;
7701;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;*to Sebastian* Such an ice king you are! A beautiful tyrant! An angelic devil! A raven with the wings of a dove! My little lamb with the appetite of a wolf... My very own Sebastian DARLING!!!;;;;;;;;
7702;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;*to Claude* Ally? What's with that cliched word? Supreme love is always a battle to death!;;;;;;;;
7703;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;I am the queen of all fruits!;;;;;;;;
7704;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;*to Sebastian* This is great! I'm getting goosebumps all over my body, Little Sebas-chan! If I have your child, I will definitely give birth to it!;;;;;;;;
7705;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;I'm going to use the heels of my shoes to step on this cold, uncaring face of yours! I want you to lick my shoes clean!;;;;;;;;
7706;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;A good man's past makes people curious! But if he's a bad man, then it makes me wanna see even more!;;;;;;;;
7707;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;"*to Sebastian* Don't say that. I'm sure you'll become addicted to the taste of my ""death scythe"".";;;;;;;;
7708;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;Even if I'm like this, I'm still the butler of death!;;;;;;;;
7709;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;Lately, I've only been encountering unsophisticated prey. My scythe and I are unsatisfied.;;;;;;;;
7710;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;Oh, Little Sebas-chan, I do love red the most. Hair, clothes, lipstick, I love them to be red. That's why I love using fresh blood to do make-up for those ugly women. The more flamboyant a woman is, the more she's as beautiful as a poisonous flower, right?;;;;;;;;
7711;(Kuroshitsuji);Grell Sutcliff;*to Sebastian* I really wanna do some vigorous exercise with you.;;;;;;;;
7712;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Those round and innocent eyes that know no filth or foulness, those tails that lovingly swish as if they belong to nobility, those paws in the soft shade of warm light pink!;;;;;;;;
7713;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Grell* You really have no standards.;;;;;;;;
7714;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Yes...I am a demon. There's no way I could understand my prey, a human's sense of taste. What I understand is...only the taste of a human's soul.;;;;;;;;
7715;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Grell* Isn't it a hot day?;;;;;;;;
7716;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Hannah* I have a contract. Even if you steal him from me, he is still my Young Master. The lot of you aren't fit to even lick his soul.;;;;;;;;
7717;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Forsake the future, sacrifice your dreams, while stained with deep despair, elude the past, fight the reality, and never relinquish your nobility. Just like that, Young Master. That is the soul I wish to consume.;;;;;;;;
7718;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Claude, teasing him* This is your way, right? Day into night, sugar into salt, dark blue into gold. Then I will turn the gold... into black.;;;;;;;;
7719;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Young Master... It's time to wake up.;;;;;;;;
7720;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Now I can show you my true nature.;;;;;;;;
7721;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Claude* How can you say that. I'm one hell of- wait, it's still early for that.;;;;;;;;
7722;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;I do not need a thousand souls, I only need one, which is my master's.;;;;;;;;
7723;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;I'm a butler. I can't let my master see the form that speaks badly of my reputation.;;;;;;;;
7724;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Ciel* I shall make it as gentle as possible.;;;;;;;;
7725;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Heaven? That has no hold over me.;;;;;;;;
7726;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Ciel* I am your knight, after all.;;;;;;;;
7727;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Unseemly... ugly... vicious... My true form.;;;;;;;;
7728;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Cats are great. They don't talk about useless things. Or do them. Nothing is cuter. They are something that don't exist in my world. They have pets over there as well...but...it doesn't quite compare.;;;;;;;;
7729;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Beast*  Wouldn't it be good to forget everything even if it's just for tonight? Indulge in pleasure...breathe a sweet poison deep into your lungs.;;;;;;;;
7730;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Ciel*  In your current state...you are even more like...My Lady.;;;;;;;;
7731;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;For a king to survive it's good for him to be able to skillfully manipulate the other pieces using both the knight and the queen. Beneath the throne the bodies of your pieces will pile up along with your sins. You must not lose.;;;;;;;;
7732;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Ciel* You're a child when it's convenient, huh.;;;;;;;;
7733;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Any game becomes boring when it lacks thrills.;;;;;;;;
7734;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;As long as there is the contract, I will protect your life. However, if you make a mistake of your own accord, you will possibly suffer a painful experience while alive. You already know that, don't you?;;;;;;;;
7735;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to William Spears* My, my. How difficult to handle alone. But this large quantity of souls, shall a demon like me offer you assistance with them?;;;;;;;;
7736;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;It has nothing to do with England or India. No matter where or when, it's the same. Humanity, that is.;;;;;;;;
7737;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*to Ciel* Well, aren't you a very young master. You have summoned me. This fact will not change for all eternity. What has been sacrificed will never be returned. Now... choose.;;;;;;;;
7738;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*talking to other servants* Why don't you all kneel down on the ground and beg for even a mere scrap of Agni's talents? Perhaps it would even improve you a little.;;;;;;;;
7739;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;However, when trying to reach your goals, you need to learn how to eat some humble pie occasionally. If you don't, one small trip one day might mean your fall.;;;;;;;;
7740;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Humans cannot reject temptation. When they are plunged into the depths of despair, likened to hell, they will hold on to anything that may help them escape from the situation they are in, even if it's merely a spider's thread, no matter what sort of humans they are.;;;;;;;;
7741;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Heaven? I don't have an affinity with that place.;;;;;;;;
7742;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;*about Finnian* I have lived for a long time, but this is my first time meeting a space alien. What kind of counter-attack is that sparkly, smiley face expecting from me?;;;;;;;;
7743;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;It seems your talent for dancing is non-existent. It must be crushing, young master.;;;;;;;;
7744;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;Now... Earl, give me that!;;;;;;;;
7745;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;*to Ciel* You don't need to tell me, I know why you came, with just one look I can tell what's on your mind.;;;;;;;;
7746;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;I wonder, if the butler isn't here, is the earl just a child who can't do anything?;;;;;;;;
7747;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;Victoria, aye? I'm not a fan. She sits herself up so high above everyone else, and leaves the painful dirty work to the earl.;;;;;;;;
7748;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;Today is a particular woman's special gala. The final great ceremony in each human's life. A funeral.;;;;;;;;
7749;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;I don't want any of the queen's money!;;;;;;;;
7750;(Kuroshitsuji);Undertaker;*to Ciel* Welcome, Earl. Do you want to see how it feels to sleep in my custom-made coffin?;;;;;;;;
7751;(Inazuma Eleven);Endou Mamoru;This is super-dimensional soccer. (he's not freaking kidding);;;;;;;;
7752;(Inazuma Eleven);Kageno Jin;My presence is thin.;;;;;;;;
7753;(Inazuma Eleven);Kageno Jin;It's been a long time since I talked this much, so I felt really nervous.;;;;;;;;
7754;(Inazuma Eleven);Kageno Jin;I came here because I want to be a man with a more visible existence.;;;;;;;;
7755;(Inazuma Eleven);Ichinose Kazuya;I want to play soccer with you Endou!;;;;;;;;
7756;(Inazuma Eleven);Ichinose Kazuya;Endou! Show me the soccer I came to love!;;;;;;;;
7757;(Inazuma Eleven);Kazemaru Ichirouta;I need to be faster.;;;;;;;;
7758;(Inazuma Eleven);Kazemaru Ichirouta;I need more power to beat Aliea Academy.;;;;;;;;
7759;(Inazuma Eleven);Kazemaru Ichirouta;I'm not as strong as you, Endou.;;;;;;;;
7760;(Inazuma Eleven);Kidou Yuuto;*to Fideo* Thanks for bringing that man back to his old self.;;;;;;;;
7761;(Inazuma Eleven);Kidou Yuuto;*to Kageyama* So this is the real you.;;;;;;;;
7762;(Inazuma Eleven);Kidou Yuuto;*to Endou* Maybe when I join your team, I may find the soccer I'm trying to find.;;;;;;;;
7763;(Inazuma Eleven);Kidou Yuuto;When I kick the ball, I feel like I'm playing with my father.;;;;;;;;
7764;(Inazuma Eleven);Kidou Yuuto;*to Haruna* I never stopped thinking about you.;;;;;;;;
7765;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;Being perfect doesn't mean I had to become Atsuya. It was to fight alongside my friends...To become one with them!;;;;;;;;
7766;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;I swore with Atsuya that I would become stronger with him.;;;;;;;;
7767;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;I'll become perfect through this match. For everyone's sakes, I have to!;;;;;;;;
7768;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;I want to be useful to the team!;;;;;;;;
7769;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;Coach please let me play in this match!;;;;;;;;
7770;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;I'm not perfect, I can't help anyone.;;;;;;;;
7771;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;If I stay here, nothing about me will change.;;;;;;;;
7772;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;Why am I sitting here? I chose to stay with the Captain and the others so I could become perfect.;;;;;;;;
7773;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;We're getting goals, right? Just leave it to me!;;;;;;;;
7774;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;You can't win without good defense.;;;;;;;;
7775;(Inazuma Eleven);Fubuki Shirou;Let's run like the wind together.;;;;;;;;
7776;(Inazuma Eleven);Endou Mamoru;On Earth, there aren't any allies or enemies when the match is over.;;;;;;;;
7777;(Inazuma Eleven);Endou Mamoru;*to Gouenji* You're always late!!;;;;;;;;
7778;(Inazuma Eleven);Endou Mamoru;Don't mind! Don't mind!;;;;;;;;
7779;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Oh, a headband! *runs off in that direction*;;;;;;;;
7780;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;In the manga, when I wasn't in the picture, even if I didn't sing nobody noticed, but if I don't sing in the anime...;;;;;;;;
7781;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Make sure you don't mistake soy sauce for sugar.;;;;;;;;
7782;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;He's so cute, I want to put peanuts in his nose.;;;;;;;;
7783;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;We'll follow her BUTT and find out what kind of guy she's dating!;;;;;;;;
7784;(K-ON!);Jun Suzuki;MAN! I'M SO JEALOUS!;;;;;;;;
7785;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;I want to be able to snap my fingers!;;;;;;;;
7786;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;The Cake is a Lie!;;;;;;;;
7787;(K-ON!);Sawako Yamanaka;Where on earth would you find such a hot fifty year old?;;;;;;;;
7788;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Wait, does that mean you're in your fifties?;;;;;;;;
7789;(K-ON!);Ritsu Tainaka;Thou art not good! Thou shalt not become a great actress at this rate!;;;;;;;;
7790;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;You and Mio-chan...you're hitting each other and bonding through bodily contact, right?;;;;;;;;
7791;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;Ritsu~! Don't do this~! MEN ARE ANIMALS!;;;;;;;;
7792;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;I have one last request. Please slap me in the face with that wad of cash.;;;;;;;;
7793;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;I'm tree G! Pose of a tree!;;;;;;;;
7794;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;I'm FLYING!;;;;;;;;
7795;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;High schoolers are kind of amazing!;;;;;;;;
7796;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Mugi-chan, you have really thick eyebrows.;;;;;;;;
7797;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;*to Ritsu* If you were a boy, I am sure you would be very popular with the girls!;;;;;;;;
7798;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;Jello is nice...;;;;;;;;
7799;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;We didn't call you because we thought you have a date with your boyfriend or something.;;;;;;;;
7800;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;All your sweets are belong to me!;;;;;;;;
7801;(K-ON!);Sawako Yamanaka;Do you want me to transform you into someone that even you won't recognize?;;;;;;;;
7802;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;*joyfully* I've never caught a cold! *they say only idiots don't catch colds*;;;;;;;;
7803;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;Tapping!?;;;;;;;;
7804;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;Speed shredding!?;;;;;;;;
7805;(K-ON!);Ritsu Tainaka;Teeth shredding!?;;;;;;;;
7806;(K-ON!);Sawako Yamanaka;I'll go out with you if you want.;;;;;;;;
7807;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Not joining a club means you become a NEET?!;;;;;;;;
7808;(K-ON!);Yui Hirasawa;Squishy~!;;;;;;;;
7809;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;I've always wanted someone to ask me if I would like fries with that.;;;;;;;;
7810;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;Would something like that make her feel better... - OH, IT DID!;;;;;;;;
7811;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;There are only two kinds of rock guitarists: Jeff Beck and everyone else.;;;;;;;;
7812;(K-ON!);Tsumugi Kotobuki;Yes, but I'd rather be friends with fun people that I don't meet often.;;;;;;;;
7813;(K-ON!);Mio Akiyama;So we're like rare animals?;;;;;;;;
7814;(Naruto);Temari;*about Shikamaru* Amazing. This slacker-clown outsmarted me!;;;;;;;;
7815;(Naruto);Temari;Sharpen your kama at sunset.;;;;;;;;
7816;(Naruto);Temari;*to Lee* Get yourself and that loser out of my way.;;;;;;;;
7817;(Naruto);Temari;*to Shikamaru* You are awfully fragile. What kind of man are you?;;;;;;;;
7818;(Naruto);Temari;Wasn't much of a match...kinda boring.;;;;;;;;
7819;(Naruto);Gaara;"There are no enemies here because we've all suffered at Akatsuki's hand! So there is no Suna, no Iwa, no Konoha, no Kiri, and no Kumo! There are only ""shinobi""!";;;;;;;;
7820;(Naruto);Gaara;He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self. That village has him, the one who cherishes a friend's bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki... Knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it.;;;;;;;;
7821;(Naruto);Gaara;This is where it all starts for me. Starting with this small bond. I too want to become someone who is needed, instead of a weapon that is feared. And as the Kazekage of Sunagakure.;;;;;;;;
7822;(Naruto);Gaara;I know him well. He takes too many risks when it comes to his friends...that's why.;;;;;;;;
7823;(Naruto);Gaara;"*to Naruto* I think of you as a friend. I used to think ""friend"" was just another word... Nothing more, nothing less. But when I met you, I realized what was important was the word's meaning.";;;;;;;;
7824;(Naruto);Gaara;*to Naruto* If you're truly prepared to take up the mantle of a Kage, then as Sasuke's friend, you know what you have to do.;;;;;;;;
7825;(Naruto);Gaara;Peace under an illusion is not a true peace. It's only meaningful if the real world manages to accomplish it.;;;;;;;;
7826;(Naruto);Gaara;When did you forsake yourselves?;;;;;;;;
7827;(Naruto);Gaara;Up until now, my bonds with others have only been ones of hatred and murder. But, seeing him fight so hard made me wonder what a bond really is. I think I understand a little now. Suffering, sadness...and joy. To be able to share it with another person. Naruto Uzumaki...when I fought him, I feel that is what he taught me.;;;;;;;;
7828;(Naruto);Gaara;Perhaps the companionship of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.;;;;;;;;
7829;(Naruto);Gaara;You're the same then. When you feel the honor of your idol under scrutiny... you become enraged, as if it were your own honor being questioned. The more precious your idol is to you... the harder you fight for him.;;;;;;;;
7830;(Naruto);Gaara;I shall kill you. I will not cease to exist.;;;;;;;;
7831;(Naruto);Gaara;*to Sasuke* You have the same eyes as I do...the eyes, filled with hatred and death, that long for strength... Just like mine. Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness.;;;;;;;;
7832;(Naruto);Gaara;I am a relic they want to get rid of, so why do I exist and live? In order to exist you need a purpose, to exist for no reason is the same as being dead... I would love only myself and fight for only myself. If all other people exist to magnify that love, then there is no more a splendid universe than this one...;;;;;;;;
7833;(Naruto);Gaara;The corpse's bitter crimson tears flow and mingle with the endless sand, filling the chaos within me - and making me stronger.;;;;;;;;
7834;(Naruto);Gaara;I finally understand... I'm alone. I won't believe in anyone, or love anyone. I'm alone.;;;;;;;;
7835;(Naruto);Gaara;What does pain feel like?;;;;;;;;
7836;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;I wasn't cast aside. It was my choice, and mine alone.;;;;;;;;
7837;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;*to Orochimaru* But why? How could you do this!? I don't get it, I've looked up to you more than anyone in the world!;;;;;;;;
7838;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;*about Sasuke* I don't care what the heck he is! If he stays, he's a danger to everyone! Don't you see!? As he gets stronger, so does the Curse Mark! That thing is feeding off his chakra! It's a Forbidden Jutsu that devours the one who bears it! It's incredible the kid's still standing. By now, he...should be dead.;;;;;;;;
7839;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;*to Orochimaru* This is no time to reminisce, you're an S-class criminal, top of the most wanted list. You've got to be taken down, and it's only fitting that I'm the one to do it. 'Cause after all, you're the one that taught me everything, right, Sensei?;;;;;;;;
7840;(Naruto);Anko Mitarashi;*to Naruto* Tough guys like you usually leave their blood all over this forest.;;;;;;;;
7841;(Naruto);Might Guy;He was a worthy opponent! A man who lived and died like a real shinobi! Kisame Hoshigaki! I'll remember that name for the rest of my life!;;;;;;;;
7842;(Naruto);Might Guy;*to Kisame* A failure will win even at the cost of their own life!;;;;;;;;
7843;(Naruto);Might Guy;That's it, Lee! Let the power of youth explode!!;;;;;;;;
7844;(Naruto);Might Guy;When a man struts around like a peacock, acting like Mr. Big Stuff, he should keep his promises. Even if it kills him.;;;;;;;;
7845;(Naruto);Might Guy;Gahh! Kakashi! You make me so mad! Why do you have to act so cool?!;;;;;;;;
7846;(Naruto);Might Guy;You have the gift of perseverance, and that's what makes you a genius too!;;;;;;;;
7847;(Naruto);Might Guy;Don't let anything stir you up the path you have drawn for yourself! Forge ahead in the end! Stick to it Lee! Make me proud! Be everything you can be!;;;;;;;;
7848;(Naruto);Might Guy;You worked hard Lee, there's no doubt in my mind the surgery will be a success. You have the power to shape your own destiny. And on the one-in-one thousand, no, one in a million chance something to happen to go wrong, I will die right along with you. Since the day I met you, my nindō has been to train you to become the most splendid ninja possible. That's a promise!;;;;;;;;
7849;(Naruto);Might Guy;*to Neji* I was a failure when I was your age, but now I can even beat Kakashi, the elite genius. It's only a matter of time until Lee finally surpasses you!;;;;;;;;
7850;(Naruto);Might Guy;People call me the Leaf's Noble Gentleman!;;;;;;;;
7851;(Naruto);Might Guy;That's it, Lee! Run...run towards the setting sun!... But don't mess up your hair!;;;;;;;;
7852;(Naruto);Might Guy;Look deep into my eyes and accept my sincere apology! Also notice my handsome manly features.;;;;;;;;
7853;(Naruto);Might Guy;*to Kakashi* What is with your attitude?! We'll never be young like this again!;;;;;;;;
7854;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;I kind of hate him.;;;;;;;;
7855;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;If you fight me, you won't be able to recover. Forfeit and withdraw.;;;;;;;;
7856;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;Never underestimate your opponent, no matter how small they may seem.;;;;;;;;
7857;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;Even if it's been a while, you should remember your comrades faces. Why? Because otherwise you will hurt their feelings when they call out to you.;;;;;;;;
7858;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;I hate explaining the same thing twice.;;;;;;;;
7859;(Naruto);Shino Aburame;This is what a real trump card is.;;;;;;;;
7860;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;If I kick enough asses I might even end up Hokage!;;;;;;;;
7861;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Let's die together.;;;;;;;;
7862;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;*to Naruto* You? Hokage? You can't even beat me! No-one's deluded enough to think that you have what it takes to become the next Hokage, not even you! Tell you what, though... I'll become Hokage in your place!;;;;;;;;
7863;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Don't think you can run away from my nose.;;;;;;;;
7864;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Heh, I don't know what's going on, but I'm always up for getting wild.;;;;;;;;
7865;(Naruto);Kiba Inuzuka;Yahoo! Akamaru, let's do this!;;;;;;;;
7866;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;I'm gonna eat until I can eat no more!;;;;;;;;
7867;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;I can't forgive you for calling me fat! But even more than that... Not just for stealing the last chip... or calling me fat... most importantly I won't forgive anyone who insults my best friend!;;;;;;;;
7868;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;Fat!? I'm big boned!;;;;;;;;
7869;(Naruto);Chouji Akimichi;*to Shikamaru* I won't let even YOU eat the last barbecue chip!;;;;;;;;
7870;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;My master entrusted me with a lot, from big things to little things. It's the same for you an unlimited number of things, don't you think it's about time for us, to be the ones who entrust not the entrusted, it's a pain in the ass but I can't say that. Someday you'll be the one to treat others to ramen and you'll be called Master Naruto... We can't stay kids forever, like Asuma and Jiraiya, I wanna be as cool as them.;;;;;;;;
7871;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*about Temari* Subtle as a rhino... she might even be scarier than my mom.;;;;;;;;
7872;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*about women, to his father* If women made you a better person, I wouldn't want to know what you were like before.;;;;;;;;
7873;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*about girls* C'mon. You know what they're like. You can never figure them out. You never know where you could stand with them. The smallest things could put you in their bad side. Always playing little mind games with you. Trying to make you do what they want. They're just a big pain basically.;;;;;;;;
7874;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;When you have that kid, I'll have to protect it. So I've gotta grow up to be a cool adult too!;;;;;;;;
7875;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;We're not stupid enough to go out there planning to die.;;;;;;;;
7876;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*to Hidan* That pathetic Lord Jashin or whatever isn't your God anymore. I am. The only one bringing down vengeance is me.;;;;;;;;
7877;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*to Hidan* See, you and I have different beliefs. I believe in the Will of Fire.;;;;;;;;
7878;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;Ughh. Great. What's the point in setting the alarm if I'm going to wake up before it goes off? What a total waste. Now I've gotta shut it off but I don't feel like moving. But if I don't shut it off it will just keep ringing and ringing. Sigh. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some mornings are such a drag...;;;;;;;;
7879;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;You would think just this once, when it was life or death, I could pull through.;;;;;;;;
7880;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;How many times do I have to tell you? The first move is always a feint.;;;;;;;;
7881;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;I never really liked Sasuke, but all the same, he's a member of the Hidden Leaf village, he's a comrade and I'll put my life on the line to help him, that's the way of our village. I know I usually seem like a pretty lazy guy, but not today. Because now, I'm responsible for your lives too.;;;;;;;;
7882;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;Sometimes I wish I was just a cloud, floating along.;;;;;;;;
7883;(Naruto);Nara Shikamaru;*about Ino* What a drag... I say a single thing against Sasuke, and I have to get that evil look from her eyes.;;;;;;;;
7884;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;"Who're you calling ""pig"", you billboard brow?!";;;;;;;;
7885;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;*to Sakura* You bloomed into a beautiful flower.;;;;;;;;
7886;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;*talking about Naruto* I could almost fall for him.;;;;;;;;
7887;(Naruto);Rock Lee;Wise words, Guy sensei! So simple but filled with such profound meaning!;;;;;;;;
7888;(Naruto);Rock Lee;The lotus of the Leaf Village blooms twice.;;;;;;;;
7889;(Naruto);Rock Lee;I want to show I can be a splendid ninja as well even if I don't have ninjutsu or genjutsu... I want to prove it to the whole world!;;;;;;;;
7890;(Naruto);Rock Lee;Sakura, please go out with me! I'll protect you with my life!;;;;;;;;
7891;(Naruto);Rock Lee;A rock thrown at a pole will not hit, but if one does not aim at the pole, it will hit! That is the law I used!;;;;;;;;
7892;(Naruto);Tenten;Amazing... The brilliance of the blade... the design. They're all beautiful! I want to take them all home!;;;;;;;;
7893;(Naruto);Tenten;Three members of Team Guy specializes in Close-Contact battles so I often render aid from the distance. I don't mind providing back up, but I was hoping to find new ninja tools that would enable me to fight on the front lines.;;;;;;;;
7894;(Naruto);Tenten;You're gonna fight Sasuke alone? And you think all of us are just gonna stand here and let you?!;;;;;;;;
7895;(Naruto);Tenten;Let's just say I don't like being kept in the dark!;;;;;;;;
7896;(Naruto);Tenten;I'm not running away and I'm not giving up. I will save this child.;;;;;;;;
7897;(Naruto);Tenten;I won't let that happen. You're not getting off that easy. No way! The people you and Raiga killed, they all wanted to live but you didn't leave them that choice! You decided for them! Well you don't get to decide this time, ok?! You're gonna live and you're going to take some responsibility for all those people's lives you cut short!;;;;;;;;
7898;(Naruto);Tenten;I can't stand weak and indecisive people!;;;;;;;;
7899;(Naruto);Tenten;I want to be a great and powerful ninja! To walk in the footsteps of the legendary kunoichi, Tsunade!;;;;;;;;
7900;(Naruto);Tenten;It's not because they're girls you know, Neji. It's just that those two are using kid gloves. It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman in battle.;;;;;;;;
7901;(Naruto);Hiruzen Sarutobi;*last words* When the tree leaves dance, one shall find flames. The fire's shadow will illuminate the village, and once again, tree leaves shall bud anew.;;;;;;;;
7902;(Naruto);Hiruzen Sarutobi;It is a place where every year shinobi are born, raised, grow old, fight, and die to protect their home. These people are precious to me. We share a home, we share a life, and though we may not share ties of blood, they are precious to me. They are my family. And if I do fall, you still will fail. I am only one of a long line. I carry this title in trust for those Hokage who came before and those who will come after. I am the Third Hokage!;;;;;;;;
7903;(Naruto);Hiruzen Sarutobi;I wonder...do you have it, young as you are... the Will of Fire?;;;;;;;;
7904;(Naruto);Hiruzen Sarutobi;He has combined Shadow Clone with his own invention, the Sexy Jutsu. What a foolish ninja technique...and he could probably get me with it, too.;;;;;;;;
7905;(Naruto);Tsunade;I am the Fifth Hokage... You've trampled on our ancestors treasure...their dream...and you will pay the price! As the Hokage, I will put a stop to you here and now!;;;;;;;;
7906;(Naruto);Tsunade;*talking to the advisers* People like Jiraiya...and Sarutobi, and Elder Chiyo of the Sand possessed something you two sorely lack. Do you know what that is!? ...Faith! My grandfather, the First Hokage, believed in you and entrusted you with the village. Now it's your turn to believe in these children and entrust it to them!;;;;;;;;
7907;(Naruto);Tsunade;Grow up... Death comes with being a shinobi. There are times when death is hard to accept, but if you don't get over it, there's no future...;;;;;;;;
7908;(Naruto);Tsunade;"*to Orochimaru about Naruto* ""I will die before I let you touch him!";;;;;;;;
7909;(Naruto);Tsunade;Why am I putting my life on the line? Because now... I am the Fifth Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!;;;;;;;;
7910;(Naruto);Tsunade;Jiraiya, are you the one who taught him the Rasengan? Are you acting like a teacher by teaching him something he can't master? Don't give him any ideas! That's why this kid likes to daydream that he's going to become Hokage someday.;;;;;;;;
7911;(Naruto);Tsunade;*about to fight Naruto* One of the Legendary Sannin taking on a snot-nosed Genin... I oughta be ashamed of myself.;;;;;;;;
7912;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;*last words* Itachi-san... It seems that in the end... I'm not so terrible after all.;;;;;;;;
7913;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;I get stronger in direct proportion to how strong my opponent is. I do not tire, and cannot be defeated.;;;;;;;;
7914;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;*to Asuma* My massive blade, Samehada, doesn't slice... It shreds to ribbons!;;;;;;;;
7915;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;Sharks start out as eggs, but incubate and hatch in the womb. Sometimes the number of pups is less than the number of eggs that were fertilized. Do you know why? Cannibalism. The pups start eating each other within the mother's womb the moment they hatch. They start killing their siblings the moment they enter the world, viewing everything they see as nothing more than prey. As of today you and I are fellow members of Akatsuki. So be careful... of me.;;;;;;;;
7916;(Naruto);Kisame Hoshigaki;I knew that from the first time I had to kill my comrades... Kill a Kiri ninja as a Kiri ninja. What does that make me? Am I a friend or foe? What is my purpose and my position? Where do I go? Where can I go? I'm well aware that my entire life has been a one giant lie.;;;;;;;;
7917;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;*to Kakashi* I died as a human!;;;;;;;;
7918;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;*last words* You were always at my side, the least I can do is to be beside you at the end. I know it cannot be, but I wish I could go to where you have gone. How I wish I could join you there, Haku.;;;;;;;;
7919;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;I can't think of a more fitting destination for a demon ninja, can you?! I'm told there are many demons down there - of all shapes and sizes! Oh yes, I should fit right in! You, on the other hand, Gatō... Well,I fear you're in for a long and very painful eternity!;;;;;;;;
7920;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;Even the unremarkable Demon of the Hidden Mist can die and become a real Demon in hell!;;;;;;;;
7921;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;Uh uh...I won't be joining Haku. Where he's gone I cannot follow. We wouldn't be welcome where Haku's gone to. Hell's where WE'RE going, Gatō!;;;;;;;;
7922;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;Well? Cat got your tongue? Are you so surprised to discover that I'm human? Even shinobi are human. No matter how hard we try, we always fail to escape that simple fact. Well at least, I have failed.;;;;;;;;
7923;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;*to Naruto* Your words cut deep, deeper than any blade.;;;;;;;;
7924;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;When you've hovered between life and death so many times that it doesn't faze you, you may be called a ninja. When you've become so deadly that your profile has been entered into my bingo book, then you may have earned the title ninja.;;;;;;;;
7925;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;You're right. Those little people and their little dreams, why should I care about them?! I have my own dream!;;;;;;;;
7926;(Naruto);Zabuza Momochi;When I was your age, my hands were already soaked in blood...;;;;;;;;
7927;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;I used to always cry and give up... I made many wrong turns... But you... You helped me find the right path... I always chased after you... I wanted to catch up to you... I wanted to walk beside you all the time... I just wanted to be with you... You changed me! Your smile is what saved me! That is why I'm not afraid to die protecting you! Because... I love you...;;;;;;;;
7928;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;I won't let you lay another finger on Naruto!;;;;;;;;
7929;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;*to Naruto* You make mistakes... but... because of those mistakes... you get the strength to stand up to them. That's why I think you are truly strong.;;;;;;;;
7930;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;*to Naruto* When I watch you, I feel strong, like I can do anything - that even I am worth something.;;;;;;;;
7931;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;You're wrong, Neji... Because I can see that you are suffering more than me... You are the one who is confused and suffering inside the fate of the head and branch families.;;;;;;;;
7932;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;Was I able to change myself...even a little, N-Naruto-kun?;;;;;;;;
7933;(Naruto);Hinata Hyuuga;I will never go back on my word, because that too is my ninja way!;;;;;;;;
7934;(Naruto);Haku;By the way, I'm a boy.;;;;;;;;
7935;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;My name is Uzumaki Naruto. I like ramen. I hate the three minutes you have to wait while the water boils. And my dream is to one day become a Hokage. Then everyone will have to respect me at last.;;;;;;;;
7936;(Naruto);Kankuro;Sasori...your strength came because of your soul, not in spite of it. You tried to erase it, to become a puppet yourself, but couldn't change completely. Now you've got your immortal body, but you've fallen, sunk to the level of the puppets you used to control. You were supposed to be a top class ninja puppeteer, not a worthless nobody who lets someone else pull the strings.;;;;;;;;
7937;(Naruto);Kankuro;How well or poorly we execute our ambush will have a huge impact on this war and how many casualties we suffer. If you wanna protect your friends and family, the only thing you should be thinking about is how to make this operation a success!;;;;;;;;
7938;(Naruto);Kankuro;*to Naruto* Aww, don't sweat it. Women always go weak in the knees for that cool, elite type of guy. So what can you do, am I right?;;;;;;;;
7939;(Naruto);Kankuro;Naruto... please save my little brother.;;;;;;;;
7940;(Naruto);Kankuro;I'll show you the real power of the battle puppet Crow.;;;;;;;;
7941;(Naruto);Kankuro;I can't back down when they show me no respect.;;;;;;;;
7942;(Naruto);Kankuro;*thinking about Naruto* This brat...I'm going to kill him.;;;;;;;;
7943;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Growth occurs when one goes beyond one's limits. Realizing that is also part of training.;;;;;;;;
7944;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;*last words* Forgive me Sasuke... It ends with this.;;;;;;;;
7945;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;*to Kisame* Those who turn their hands against their comrades are sure to die a terrible death. Be prepared.;;;;;;;;
7946;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;The people of this clan are all the same. You focus on the trivial, and lose sight of what's most important. Change is impossible, in this fog of ignorance. How can we evolve when regulation is all we know?;;;;;;;;
7947;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;I've had enough, there's no hope left for this pathetic clan.;;;;;;;;
7948;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Don't cry, Sasuke. Your big brother is here to protect you, no matter what happens.;;;;;;;;
7949;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;You and I are flesh and blood. I'm always going to be there for you, even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me. That's what big brothers are for.;;;;;;;;
7950;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;*last words* Just when me and Kakashi were becoming friends... I couldn't bring myself to confess to Rin... I wish I had more time with everyone...;;;;;;;;
7951;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;*to Kakashi* I'm about to... die... but I'll become your eye.;;;;;;;;
7952;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;"I believe the ""White Fang"" is a true hero!";;;;;;;;
7953;(Naruto);Obito Uchiha;*to Kakashi* I am Uchiha Obito and I will surpass you once I awaken my Sharingan!;;;;;;;;
7954;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;I have already awakened.;;;;;;;;
7955;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;I don't understand what's going on, but I'll just pretend that I do. *nods head in agreement*;;;;;;;;
7956;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;*to Naruto* Finding a new me, that is the lesson you taught me.;;;;;;;;
7957;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;"I decided I wished to be like you as well, Naruto-kun, and for that reason...with Orochimaru-sama now intregrated into this body, I plan on finding a new ""me"", one stronger than Orochimaru-sama himself!";;;;;;;;
7958;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;Hehehe...you can't beat me. You have no skills, unlike Sasuke.;;;;;;;;
7959;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;*to Naruto* You've just thrown it all away! Dreams don't come true when you're dead!;;;;;;;;
7960;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;Little kids think life is so easy. That's why they go on and on about their dreams. That's why they never give up.;;;;;;;;
7961;(Naruto);Kabuto Yakushi;Oh you look so beautiful... We're not here for a picnic you know.;;;;;;;;
7962;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;Don't worry, this will be over in five seconds.;;;;;;;;
7963;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;We're just some normal ninja, we don't want to see what's under your mask.;;;;;;;;
7964;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;*to Naruto* Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you. He was always boasting about you, saying you were like his own grandchild. He had faith that you were the one who would inherit his will, and truly believed that you would one day be a great Hokage. Lord Jiraiya will always watch over you. Even this very minute, he's watching from somewhere. He wouldn't be happy seeing you sad like this. So...be your usual self, the one he praised so much. Don't stay depressed forever. For Lord Jiraiya himself, one of the Legendary Sannin...acknowledged you as his promising student!;;;;;;;;
7965;(Naruto);Iruka Umino;So I acted like an idiot. It was tough, has it been lonely for you Naruto, was it tough Naruto??;;;;;;;;
7966;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;We are humans, not fish. We don't know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That's what death is, don't you think?;;;;;;;;
7967;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;You are weak. Why are you so weak? Because you lack... hatred.;;;;;;;;
7968;(Naruto);Rock Lee;If I can't do 400 push-ups, I'll hit the dummy 800 times! If I can't hit the dummy 800 times, I'll do 2000 jump ropes!;;;;;;;;
7969;(Naruto);Rock Lee;I am the Handsome Devil of the Hidden Leaf Village! My name is Rock Lee!;;;;;;;;
7970;(Naruto);Rock Lee;Guy-sensei is the coolest! He practically GLOWS with cool!;;;;;;;;
7971;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Stop calling me Ero-sennin!!;;;;;;;;
7972;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Baka, baka, baka!! They found out I was peeking! Now my research is ruined!;;;;;;;;
7973;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;The only thing that can keep a fire from dying and give it more power, is wind.;;;;;;;;
7974;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;If I become as strong as you, will I really become like you? To die as a tool...that's...that's just too sad.;;;;;;;;
7975;(Naruto);Jiraiya;*last words* The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki... yes... that has a nice ring to it.;;;;;;;;
7976;(Naruto);Jiraiya;There, that ending...was a little better. The frog at the bottom of the well drifts off into the great ocean. Heh heh ...yep. Pretty damn honorable... pretty damn honorable...;;;;;;;;
7977;(Naruto);Jiraiya;*to Naruto* I think we all have to acknowledge you. Gamatatsu, Gamakichi, Sakura, Tsunade...and I... We all admit you've worked really hard. But I wonder what's pushing you forward.;;;;;;;;
7978;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Never go back on your word...and never give up. That's your ninja way...and as your mentor ... I have no business whining! Because the student's ninja way should be the master's too! Isn't that so, Naruto?!;;;;;;;;
7979;(Naruto);Jiraiya;The true measure of a shinobi is not how he lives, but how he dies.;;;;;;;;
7980;(Naruto);Jiraiya;*to Orochimaru about Sasuke* Because it's no fun to train a genius!;;;;;;;;
7981;(Naruto);Jiraiya;*to Orochimaru* You're wrong, that's not what makes a shinobi. You never did get it, a real ninja is one who endures no matter what gets thrown at him... Let me explain something to you, there is only one thing that matters if you are a shinobi, and it isn't the number of jutsu you possess. All you do need, is the guts to never give up.;;;;;;;;
7982;(Naruto);Jiraiya;*to Naruto* Even I can tell that hatred is spreading. I wanted to do something about it...but I don't know what. I believe... that someday the day will come when people truly understand one another!! If I can't find the answer, it will be up to you to do it!!;;;;;;;;
7983;(Naruto);Jiraiya;When people get hurt, they learn to hate... When people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow... and how you grow is up to you.;;;;;;;;
7984;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Wherever someone thinks of you, that's where home is.;;;;;;;;
7985;(Naruto);Jiraiya;I'm not a pervert... I'm a super pervert!;;;;;;;;
7986;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Die! Just Die! You have no talent at all!!;;;;;;;;
7987;(Naruto);Jiraiya;Shut up you flat-chested bitch Tsunade!;;;;;;;;
7988;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;You are the strongest enemy I have ever fought.;;;;;;;;
7989;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;No one can determine another's destiny.;;;;;;;;
7990;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;The heavens will not allow a pawn who can only seek victory at the cost of himself to advance...;;;;;;;;
7991;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;*about Gai* He's so childish. He acts like a seven-year-old!;;;;;;;;
7992;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;*about Lee and Gai* As usual, I can't keep up with their craziness.;;;;;;;;
7993;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Because Naruto... you saved me from the darkness.;;;;;;;;
7994;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;All this time I've been called a genius, so I cannot lose.;;;;;;;;
7995;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Sasuke's out there right now, heading toward Orochimaru. We can't allow such evil to take someone from our village... that is not our way.;;;;;;;;
7996;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Naruto... Sometimes, your eyes are even better than mine.;;;;;;;;
7997;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Father, is a person's destiny a thing like a cloud flowing with an inescapable flow? Or can a person choose the flow he wishes... I still don't know the answer to this. Either way the destination may be the same in the end. However by choosing to live like the latter, a person can live and strive towards a goal. And in this match I have finally understood those who have that are truly strong. Father, I have but one goal, I want to become stronger... Enough not to lose to anyone... That's how I feel. Father, the birds are flying freely today... They look so happy.;;;;;;;;
7998;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;There's no method but death to escape this horrible curse.;;;;;;;;
7999;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;The curse represents a mark of the bird in a cage... It is... the symbol of being tied down to an inescapable destiny.;;;;;;;;
8000;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;*to Naruto* These eyes of mine show me many things. One thing they've shown me...people's limitations are set, fixed, and unchangeable. Only a fool wastes his time trying to become something he can never be!;;;;;;;;
8001;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Do you understand now? You have no way of beating me!;;;;;;;;
8002;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Once a failure, always a failure. You can't change that.;;;;;;;;
8003;(Naruto);Neji Hyuuga;Right now, Sasuke is in the darkness. The only one who can save him is you, Naruto.;;;;;;;;
8004;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Try it trash! I'll return the pain a thousand times over!;;;;;;;;
8005;(Naruto);Jiraiya;I am, Jiraiya, the epitome of manliness! I shall fall for no woman's wiles! When you're me, you only need to flash that sexiness to have women fall at your feet.;;;;;;;;
8006;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;WHAT?! Why wasn't he affected by my sexiness?!;;;;;;;;
8007;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;SHIKAMARU! Beat her up with a 16 HIT COMBO!;;;;;;;;
8008;(Naruto);Ino Yamanaka;There's no meaning to a flower unless it blooms.;;;;;;;;
8009;(Naruto);Gaara;A soul needs a purpose to live...and so I concluded that my purpose was to kill everyone besides myself. I felt alive...;;;;;;;;
8010;(Naruto);Gaara;I fight for my sake only and live to love no one but myself.;;;;;;;;
8011;(Naruto);Gaara;*young Gaara attempts to slash his wrist* It's no use, the sand gets in the way.;;;;;;;;
8012;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;The concept of hope is nothing more than giving up. A word that holds no true meaning.;;;;;;;;
8013;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;The Uchiha is a clan destined for revenge...;;;;;;;;
8014;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;*to Minato, about his reason for attacking Konoha* Oh, you know...it's fun, it's part of my plan...to start a war...to bring peace...;;;;;;;;
8015;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;It will be a new world... A world of truth, not lies.;;;;;;;;
8016;(Naruto);Madara Uchiha;When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred.;;;;;;;;
8017;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*to Sasuke* No matter how far Orochimaru fell, he still loved him... Now I know how the Third Hokage felt.;;;;;;;;
8018;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*to Sakumo* Regardless of what happened, you did the best you could. I understand that now...you broke the rules for all our sakes - I'm proud of you now...;;;;;;;;
8019;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*to Pain* The people from this village are different from your average village. Even if it means dying, there's not a single one of us, who would sell out a comrade.;;;;;;;;
8020;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*to Naruto* You've become as strong...if not stronger than me.;;;;;;;;
8021;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Like the fate of the two who founded the village of Konoha... Naruto and Sasuke...your fates are like theirs.;;;;;;;;
8022;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;This place makes me think about the mistakes I've made in the past... and I've made a lot.;;;;;;;;
8023;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*to Orochimaru* I don't care if you are one of the legendary Sannin, the great shinobi of legend, I swear take one more step towards Sasuke and one of us will die here!;;;;;;;;
8024;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I'm Kakashi Hatake. Things I like and things I hate...I don't feel like telling you that. My dreams for the future...never really thought about it. As for my hobbies...I have lots of hobbies.;;;;;;;;
8025;(Naruto);Rock Lee;"A genius, huh? What does that mean? ""Genius""? So I was not born with a whole lot of natural talent, not gifted like Neji ...but I work hard and I never give up! That is my gift, that is my ninja way!";;;;;;;;
8026;(Naruto);Orochimaru;*to Sasuke* I refuse...to let this happen! I am Orochimaru! I am immortal! I will not die here! Destined to discover the true meaning behind everything! Destined to take control of everything in this world!!;;;;;;;;
8027;(Naruto);Orochimaru;When there is a true desire in the heart and that desire is strong... That is when he finds real strength that even he did not know he had!;;;;;;;;
8028;(Naruto);Orochimaru;Everything will be mine.;;;;;;;;
8029;(Naruto);Orochimaru;*about Sasuke* When I watch this boy, I look back to the time I was called a genius, and think how ridiculous it was.;;;;;;;;
8030;(Naruto);Orochimaru;*to Sasuke* How impressive. A thousand foes stand before you and you don't even bat an eyelid.;;;;;;;;
8031;(Naruto);Orochimaru;*talking about Naruto* This child... intrigues me to no end!;;;;;;;;
8032;(Naruto);Orochimaru;Hate only gives birth to even more hate.;;;;;;;;
8033;(Naruto);Orochimaru;"I want to obtain all the jutsu and gain a true understanding of everything in this world. The first one to mix blue and yellow called the new color ""green"". I want to do something similar to that. If blue is the chakra, then yellow is the seal, and green is the jutsu... Just as there is no end to the variety of colors, there are so many thousands...tens of thousands of jutsu in the world as well. But in order to obtain every possible jutsu and truth, it would require an eternity. Only one who understands everything after spending such time on this can be fittingly called the Ultimate Being.";;;;;;;;
8034;(Naruto);Orochimaru;*to Kabuto, talking about Tsunade) The best medicines always taste bitter.;;;;;;;;
8035;(Naruto);Orochimaru;There probably isn't any meaning in life. Perhaps you can find something interesting to do while you are alive. Like how you found that flower. Like how I found you.;;;;;;;;
8036;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;Naruto's here because he's made up his mind. My resolve is nothing compared to his now! I'm supposed to be a ninja, but all I've ever done is lean on him and cry... I was supposed to change that... I came here and I thought I was ready. But I can't do anything... I can't say anything. The only thing that remains for me...is to believe in them!;;;;;;;;
8037;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;*about killing Sasuke* I... Sasuke... I... I thought I could do this...;;;;;;;;
8038;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;I'm the one who made Naruto suffer the most... I've just been getting it wrong. Just been messing it up... I don't want to get it wrong anymore...don't want to screw it up anymore.;;;;;;;;
8039;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;*talking to Yamato* Same as always... I can only do the dumbest of things for Naruto...;;;;;;;;
8040;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;A smile is the easiest way out of a difficult situation.;;;;;;;;
8041;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;*to Sasuke* I... I love you with all my heart!.. If you were to stay here with me, there would be no regrets...because every day we'd do something fun, we'd be happy I swear..! I would do anything for you! So...please, just stay with me!;;;;;;;;
8042;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;I've always considered myself to be a true ninja...but those were just empty words, because Sasuke and Naruto were always in the lead! But now it's my turn to take the lead, and all of you can watch me from the background!;;;;;;;;
8043;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;*to Ino* Didn't you know? Women have to be strong in order to survive!;;;;;;;;
8044;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;All I've been doing is watching you two from behind... Now, get a good look at MY back!;;;;;;;;
8045;(Naruto);Sakura Haruno;*talking to Sasuke* On that day, you taught me that solitude is painful! I understand that so well right now. I have family, and I have friends but if you're gone... To me... It will be the same as being alone.;;;;;;;;
8046;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum, that's true, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.;;;;;;;;
8047;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;I won't allow my comrades to die. I'll protect you with my life. Trust me.;;;;;;;;
8048;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.;;;;;;;;
8049;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*making excuses for being late, as usual* Hello students, today I got lost on the road of life.;;;;;;;;
8050;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;*making excuses for being late, as usual* A cute girl stopped me on the way, so I danced.;;;;;;;;
8051;(Naruto);Hatake Kakashi;Naruto, it's nice that you removed the poison so spiritedly, but you'll bleed to death if you lose any more blood... Seriously...;;;;;;;;
8052;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;"People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define ""reality"". But what does it mean to be ""correct"" or ""true""? Merely vague concepts... Their ""reality"" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?";;;;;;;;
8053;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;If you want to kill me, despise me, hate me, and live in an unsightly way... Run, and cling to life, and then some day, when you have the same eyes as I do, come before me.;;;;;;;;
8054;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;You aren't even worth killing, foolish little brother.;;;;;;;;
8055;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;If you think I'm just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that's fine. Following Itachi's path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don't know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I'll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they'll understand what it's like to taste... a little of my hatred.;;;;;;;;
8056;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;*Talking to Naruto* Just shut up for once! What the hell do you know about it?! It's not like you ever had a family in the first place! You were on your own right from the beginning, what makes you think you know anything about it?! Huh?! I'm suffering now because I had those ties, how on earth could you possibly understand, what it feels like to lose all that?!;;;;;;;;
8057;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;*Introducing himself to Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura* My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things, and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan, and kill a certain someone.;;;;;;;;
8058;(Naruto);Sasuke Uchiha;I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.;;;;;;;;
8059;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;Hey, you stupid fox! You're in my body and you owe me rent! So for payment, I'll take your chakra! You got that?!;;;;;;;;
8060;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;The pain of being alone...is not an easy one to bear. Why is it...that I can understand your pain? But...I already have many people who are important to me now...and I can't let you hurt any of them. Even if I have to kill you!;;;;;;;;
8061;(Naruto);Naruto Uzumaki;I won't run away anymore... I won't go back on my word... That is my ninja way!;;;;;;;;
8062;(One Piece);Portgas D. Ace;Thank you... for loving me!;;;;;;;;
8063;(One Piece);Gecko Moria;Fine! Go see for yourself, Straw Hat... What a real nightmare is... In the New World!;;;;;;;;
8064;(One Piece);Usopp;A dumbass is still a dumbass. *looking at Duval's new face*;;;;;;;;
8065;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;A place where you can never ever EVER enter? *Luffy, in Skypea*;;;;;;;;
8066;(One Piece);Whitebeard;The name of this era is WHITEBEARD!;;;;;;;;
8067;(One Piece);Whitebeard;I am only one man with one heart... Call me a demon, call me a monster... but I can't be the strongest forever!!!;;;;;;;;
8068;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;I am going to save you even if it kills me.;;;;;;;;
8069;(One Piece);Brook;I wonder if it'll be fun to see mermaid-san's panties.;;;;;;;;
8070;(One Piece);Whitebeard;These fools... thinking that this might truly be enough to take my life... I need no help! I AM WHITEBEARD!!!;;;;;;;;
8071;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;*talking to Zoro* The world's greatest swordsman, that's great! And it's fitting since your new boss is going to be King of the Pirates! Anything else would make me look bad!;;;;;;;;
8072;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Just shut up with your god crap, already!!! What kind of GOD... CAN'T SAVE A SINGLE DAMN THING??!!;;;;;;;;
8073;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;A wound that'd make an ordinary man unconscious... I won't lose to it. A wound that would kill an ordinary person... I won't lose to it! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes... I can't allow myself to be ordinary!;;;;;;;;
8074;(One Piece);Marshall D. Teach;Let the heavens deal with life and death, even the most fearful lose to that. Let's live for another moment!;;;;;;;;
8075;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;"It's not like ""thanks"" are something I can eat.";;;;;;;;
8076;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;There should be a limit to how similar a couple looks like.;;;;;;;;
8077;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.;;;;;;;;
8078;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;If you kill yourself, I'll kill you.;;;;;;;;
8079;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;*to Captain Kuro* If you want to compare ambitions, mine is bigger!;;;;;;;;
8080;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;"Well, how about this. My ""luck"" versus this thing's ""curse"". Wanna see what's stronger..? If I lose, then I'm just that much of a man anyways...";;;;;;;;
8081;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;If I get reincarnated.... I wanna become a clam.;;;;;;;;
8082;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;There is someone that I must meet again. And until that day...not even Death itself can take my life away!;;;;;;;;
8083;(One Piece);Crocodile;Weakness is a sin.;;;;;;;;
8084;(One Piece);Enel;People don't fear god, fear itslef is god.;;;;;;;;
8085;(One Piece);Sanji;You selfish people! Can't you see that he's hungry? Why do you hurt him? I think he is sick, so he can't find food by himself. Am I right? Here! Eat this food. *Luffy tries to eat Sanji* Die!!;;;;;;;;
8086;(One Piece);Sanji;A cow? A cow can swim? I think it's a hippo!;;;;;;;;
8087;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Let's continue eating.;;;;;;;;
8088;(One Piece);Nojiko;Since 8 years ago, that girl has never cried again, and she's never asked anyone for help. Because she doesn't want to die like our mother. She was 10 years old, and Nami decided to fight alone in that situation. Have you ever realized how much pain she's been going through?;;;;;;;;
8089;(One Piece);Sanji;Any person who hurts Nami-san's feelings! I won't let them live peacefully!;;;;;;;;
8090;(One Piece);Usopp;*talking about Nami* Because it was the only way to save the village, she decided to join the people who killed her mother.;;;;;;;;
8091;(One Piece);Nami;Just one more time and everything will be the same. Everything will come back to me. And I will be free from Arlong. Bellemere-san. Finally, I can laugh with all my heart.;;;;;;;;
8092;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Why does that man have a pinwheel on his head?;;;;;;;;
8093;(One Piece);Nami;Everyone is expecting help from you, but you come here and don't think about doing anything to help those people?;;;;;;;;
8094;(One Piece);Nami;Why? The work that the marines should be doing now...there are many things that you have to take care of. Don't know that Arlong has killed many people and destroyed many villages? Under his control, everyone was treated like a slave! And you didn't do a single thing about that!! And now you just want to find the treasure of one thief? Is this a real government?;;;;;;;;
8095;(One Piece);Nami;Don't touch Bellemere-san's orange with your dirty hands! I won't give that money to you. That money is...;;;;;;;;
8096;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Don't you dare make my navigator cry!!;;;;;;;;
8097;(One Piece);Sanji;Moron! I'm not worried about you. I meant that you shouldn't take all the credit for yourself.;;;;;;;;
8098;(One Piece);Marshall D. Teach;There is no such thing as impossible in this world.;;;;;;;;
8099;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;I don't know. I'm not sure why myself. But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises and many other deals 'til now, will all go to waste and I'll never be able to return before you, ever again.;;;;;;;;
8100;(One Piece);Gecko Moria;A true pirate should fear nothing, not even death!;;;;;;;;
8101;(One Piece);Nico Robin;Sometimes the only thing you have to doubt is your own common sense.;;;;;;;;
8102;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Being alone hurts worse than pain.;;;;;;;;
8103;(One Piece);Shanks;Your honor isn't worth your life.;;;;;;;;
8104;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;If you don't want the negative reputation you shouldn't be a pirate.;;;;;;;;
8105;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;I won't let you touch him. Young master would be sullied if an inferior, dirty person like you were to touch him. *says to Alois*;;;;;;;;
8106;(One Piece);Kizaru;Victory or defeat can be determined in a single moments misstep.;;;;;;;;
8107;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Under one of your orders, I am to be your pawn and your sword. So please, young master, move me into check.;;;;;;;;
8108;(Kuroshitsuji);Sebastian Michaelis;Even though I dislike being kicked by others, I do enjoy the feeling of kicking others.;;;;;;;;
8109;(One Piece);Coby;We shouldn't worry about being able to achieve our dreams, as long as we have the desire to do it!;;;;;;;;
8110;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;So what if you're a girl.;;;;;;;;
8111;(Axis Powers: Hetalia);South Italy;Listen to this! I woke up earlier than Germany for once!;;;;;;;;

8113;(One Piece);Don Krieg;When a guy gets flustered, because someone calls him weak, it's proof that he recognizes he IS weak. Let the outcome determine the weak and the strong.;;;;;;;;
8114;(Kuroshitsuji);Alois Trancy;I want you, Ciel Phantomhive. That's all there is to it.;;;;;;;;
8115;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;If I can't even protect my captain's dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk...;;;;;;;;
8116;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;Dying is not repaying a debt! That is not what he saved you for! Only weak men would die after someone spared their lives!;;;;;;;;
8117;(One Piece);Dracule Mihawk;I don't remember the name of every weakling I crush.;;;;;;;;
8118;(One Piece);Bellemere;No matter what happens, don't be sorry you were born. Even though nobody praises us, don't forget to smile in any situation. As long as you're alive there will be better things later...and there will be many.;;;;;;;;
8119;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;When you decided to go to the sea, it was your own decision. Whatever happens to you on the sea, it depends on what you've done! Don't blame others!!;;;;;;;;
8120;(One Piece);Nami;Hopes for the future..? Yes. However, getting there with you...is not much different than being alone..! What good is the treasure if I'm alone? After sharing so much of our dreams. Instead of sacrificing them and leaving with you I would rather... HAVE NOTHING AT ALL!;;;;;;;;
8121;(One Piece);Sanji;I don't care if you're a god. If you lay even one finger on Nami-san, I'll become the Devil of the Blue Sea!;;;;;;;;
8122;(One Piece);Boa Hancock;Fufufu.. I think I like you.;;;;;;;;
8123;(One Piece);Marshall D. Teach;A man's dream never dies!;;;;;;;;
8124;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;I don't want to conquer anything. I just think the guy with the most freedom in this whole ocean... is the Pirate King!;;;;;;;;
8125;(One Piece);Silvers Rayleigh;*talking to Luffy* Can you really do this..? The Grand Line is just going to keep going on...surpassing your wildest imaginations! And the enemies will be strong. Can you really conquer this ultimate ocean?;;;;;;;;
8126;(One Piece);Brook;Yohohohoho!;;;;;;;;
8127;(One Piece);Kizaru;Have you ever been kicked at the speed of light?;;;;;;;;
8128;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;You'll never understand...your swords will never be as heavy as mine!;;;;;;;;
8129;(One Piece);Shanks;You can spill drinks on me, even spit on me. I'll just laugh about it. But If you dare to hurt my friends... I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!;;;;;;;;
8130;(One Piece);Brook;Would you let me see your panties?;;;;;;;;
8131;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;If you do anything that would cause me to abandon my ambitions... You will end your own life on my sword!;;;;;;;;
8132;(One Piece);Gol D. Roger;Inherited will. Destiny of the age. The dreams of the people. These are things that will not be stopped. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of freedom. These things will never cease to be.;;;;;;;;
8133;(One Piece);Usopp;There... Comes a time when a man has to stand and FIGHT!! This is the time when his friends dreams are laughed at. Luffy wont die... I KNOW he'll be the pirate king one day. I WONT LET YOU LAUGH AT THAT!!;;;;;;;;
8134;(One Piece);Usopp;Then stand up right away! And don't act like you're about to die! It's not like you! Even if there are billows of smoke, we can still see the sky. We can still see the ocean! It ain't like it's hell here! So don't act like you're about to die!;;;;;;;;
8135;(One Piece);Sanji;I'll never kick a woman, even if I die!;;;;;;;;
8136;(One Piece);Sanji;A man forgives a woman's lies.;;;;;;;;
8137;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;I have Nakama who're not strong... But I still want them to be with me..!!So I have to be stronger than anybody else... Or I'll lose them all!!!;;;;;;;;
8138;(One Piece);Franky;Existing Isn't A Crime!;;;;;;;;
8139;(One Piece);Nami;*talking about Usopp and Luffy* It's never ending with those idiots. HEY! Lay off the sob stories! You know how dangerous this island is! Let's not give it any help in killing us!;;;;;;;;
8140;(One Piece);Sanji;That's no way to treat a lady!;;;;;;;;
8141;(One Piece);Nami;I'll have mapped out the entire world!;;;;;;;;
8142;(One Piece);Usopp;I'll be brave!;;;;;;;;

8147;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;*after seeing a skinny woman claiming to be Alvita* Don't you mean you're like half of her?;;;;;;;;
8148;(One Piece);Sanji;It's time to get a girl.;;;;;;;;
8149;(One Piece);Gol D. Roger;Bear conviction under your flag!;;;;;;;;
8150;(One Piece);Usopp;Protecting what we cherish most as men is the reason why we formed this pirate crew!;;;;;;;;
8151;(One Piece);Shanks;*after saving Luffy and losing one arm* It isn't worth much. It's just one arm. I'm glad you're safe.;;;;;;;;
8152;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;Fine! I'd rather be a pirate than die here!;;;;;;;;
8153;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;I am always serious.;;;;;;;;
8154;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;I want to eat meat!;;;;;;;;
8155;(One Piece);Roronoa Zoro;I do things my own way! So don't give me any lip about it!;;;;;;;;
8156;(One Piece);Shanks;*to Luffy* Keep this hat safe for me?;;;;;;;;
8157;(One Piece);Gol D. Roger;My wealth and treasures? If you want it, I'll let you have it. Look for it, I left all of it at that place!;;;;;;;;
8158;(One Piece);Monkey D. Luffy;*talking to Shanks* One day, I'll have a ship and a crew better than yours!! And we'll have the biggest hoard of treasure in the world!!;;;;;;;;
8159;(One Piece);Shanks;I'm saying it's not safe to point guns.;;;;;;;;

That is the deal between the Shinigami and the first human to get their hands on the note in the human world. Once you enter prison, I don't know when you'll die. It's annoying to wait.

8463;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;Listen up! Let's say you drink too much strawberry milk, and have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. But it's cold outside your bed. You don't want to get up, but the urge to urinate is just too strong! You make up your mind to go! You run to the bathroom, stand in front of the toilet, and let loose! You think that all your life has led to this moment! But then you realize! It isn't the bathroom, you're still in bed! That feeling of lukewarm wetness spreads like wildfire! But you don't stop! You can't stop! That's what I'm talking about! THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE STRAWBERRY MILK! DO YOU GET IT!?;;;;;;;;

8468;(Gintama);Gintoki Sakata;That's a good attitude. You should hate me more, curse me more, and detest me! Then you should take the power of that hatred and use it to survive in this rotten world. (parody of Naruto, Itachi);;;;;;;;

8549;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;I'm sure it's just some pretty girl talking about me somewhere.;;;;;;;;
8550;(Bleach);Urahara Kisuke;I'm so disappointed, Ichigo, so very disappointed. Sadly, your sword exhibits only fear. When you counter, it's because you fear being killed. When you attack, you fear killing. And when you protect someone, you fear you could let them die. At this point, the only thing your sword speaks is senseless fright, and that's not good. What you don't need in battle is fear. Nothing will come of it. When you counter, you don't let them cut you. When you protect someone, you don't let them die. And when you attack, you kill.;;;;;;;;
8551;(Bleach);Zaraki Kenpachi;Everyone who searches for power, without exception, searches for battle. Do you fight in order to become more powerful? Or do you want more power so you can fight?;;;;;;;;

8557;(Bokura ga Ita);Motoharu Yano;I want to go back and change the past. If I could - I would, if that would stop you from crying.;;;;;;;;
8558;(Naruto);Itachi Uchiha;Foolish brother, if you wish to kill me - hate me, detest me, and survive in an unsightly way. Run... run and cling to life.;;;;;;;;

These false memories planted in me giving me a life as one of the herd. And yet, the truth continues to guide me toward itself. That's right. It wasn't me who was wrong. It was the world. The world has to change so I will change it.;;;;;;;;
8567;(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion);Lelouch Lamperouge;The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.;;;;;;;;
8568;(Bleach);Aizen Sousuke;Why are you putting so much distance between us? If you want to make sure it hits me, then you should get close and fire. Or is it that you're afraid of letting even a part of me out of your field of vision by getting close? If that's the case, then it's a foolish thought. Distance only has meaning in a fight between equals. With you and I, distance holds no meaning at all. Watch... If I do this, my hand is almost instantly at your heart.;;;;;;;;

8596;(Bleach);Kurosaki Ichigo;"I'm not Superman, so I can't say anything big like ""I'll protect everyone on Earth!"". I'm not a modest guy who will say ""It's enough if I can protect as many people as my two hands can handle."" either. I want to protect...a mountain-load of people.";;;;;;;;
